# Section I: Heroes & Magic

## Introduction

Delving Deeper is a gateway to realms where magic works and
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) are real, where
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) and
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1) fight alongside
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) against
[goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins) and
[giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants), and where a strong
sword arm can carry the day in battle. All that is needed to play is
some basic stationery, a few friends, and a vivid imagination.

One player will referee the fantasy
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) while the
others assume the role of adventurers and explore it. As heroes and
wizards they will face its challenges, defeating
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) and winning
fabulous [treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) as
they rise to fame or, if they are careless, vanish into obscurity.

### About These Rules

Players should begin with [Section
I](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#section-i-heroes-and-magic) which
details characters that can be played,
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment) and
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) that can be
had, and
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) that
are available to magic-using sorts. Players need read no further.

Aspiring referees are advised to continue immediately on to [Section
II](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#section-ii-delving-and-exploration)
wherein are guidelines for constructing a [campaign
world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) and filling
it with
[dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon),
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2), and
[treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), and advice
on conducting adventures around these. Finally, [Section
III](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#section-iii-monsters-and-treasures)
is intended as a reference for referees; it contains all manner of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)—from
[androids](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#androids) to
[zombies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#zombies)—and
[treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) including
magical [wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands),
weapons, and a plethora of other items.

### Common Terms

Delving Deeper is a role-playing game in which the players control
player characters (PCs) and the referee controls non-player characters
(NPCs) including
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). All these
have a number of [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) (HD)
which are six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) thrown to see how
many [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
(hp) can be sustained before being slain. [Armor
class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee) (AC) is a measure of
protection against physical attack, while [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) are made to
avert fates such as
[poisoning](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison_1), being turned
to stone, or being vaporized by [dragon’s
breath](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragon-breath-weapon).
Player characters accumulate [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) (XP) in
order to advance to each successive level of
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities).

##### Distances, Ranges, and Movement Rates

are given as inches. An inch represents a real
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3)
according to the [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) of
play. At the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) 1" represents 10
feet. At the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) 1" represents 10
yards. At the overland and ocean exploration
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) 1" of
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
represents 1 mile per day.

##### Dungeon Level

pertains to depth underground. The 1st
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level is the shallowest, the 2nd
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level is the next deeper level, and so on. Deeper
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels are more dangerous and more rewarding than shallower
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels. Players will usually determine what
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level they wish to explore.

##### Experience Level

ranks the relative power of player characters. Players begin at the 1st
(least powerful) experience level and work their way upward. While
experience levels are theoretically unlimited these rules assume the
majority of play will occur at the 1st through 12th experience levels.

##### Gold Pieces

(gp) are the basic unit of currency for which goods are traded. One gold
piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. There are 20 coins
of any type to one pound.

##### Heroic-Types

include all [man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)
of heroic stature and all
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) that
represent a heroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures with 3
or more [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) but
fewer than 7 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Man-Types

are all [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) and other
creatures of same basic proportions including
[androids](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#androids),
[cavemen](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cavemen),
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1),
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1),
[gnolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gnolls),
[gnomes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gnomes),
[goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins),
[halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1),
[hobgoblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hobgoblins),
[kobolds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#kobolds),

[nixies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#nixies),
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs), and
[pixies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#pixies). The majority of
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-types are also
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) but
exceptional individuals can be
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)- or
[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
instead.

##### Monsters

[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons),
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs),
[vampires](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vampires), and other
genuine horrors of the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)
as well as the townsfolk,
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings), and even
non-player heroes of the game
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world).

##### A Morale Check

is a throw of two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) used by the
referee to determine the behavior of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (including
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)) in
potentially life-threatening circumstances, particularly in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).

##### Normal-Missiles

are all non-magical projectiles including
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears), stones,
[arrows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#arrows-and-bolts), and
[bolts](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#arrows-and-bolts) loosed by
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types). An otherwise
normal missile loosed by a
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
is considered
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types).

##### Normal-Types

include all [man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)
of less than [heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)
status and all other creatures of similar stature. Collectively these
are all creatures with fewer than 3 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Normal-Weapons

are all non-magical arms including swords,
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears),

[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types). An otherwise
normal weapon wielded by a
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
is considered
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types).

##### A Reaction Check

is a throw of two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) used by the
referee to determine how
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (including
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)) will
[react](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monster-reaction) to the
players, particularly upon their first meeting and in negotiations.

##### A Saving Throw

is a throw of a single twenty-sided die used by the player to avert a
potentially life-threatening calamity such as being
[poisoned](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison_1), turned to
stone, or vaporized by a
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon).

##### Superheroic-Types

include all [man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)
of superheroic stature and all
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) that
represent a superheroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures
with 7 or more [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### A Survival Check

is a throw of a hundred-sided die used by the player or referee to
determine whether a character or
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will survive
being raised from the dead,
[polymorphed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#baleful-polymorph)
into another shape, or restored to flesh after being turned to stone.

##### Turns

are any period during which a player chooses an action for his
character. At the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) and
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scales](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) a turn represents
one minute. At the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
exploration [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) a turn
represents ten minutes. At the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) a turn
represents one day.

### Player’s Supplies

The supplies essential for play are detailed below, followed by optional
extras which a player may desire. The essentials are all readily
available and inexpensive (or free); even polyhedral
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) are easily
obtained at hobby stores and online.

The Essentials:

-   Delving Deeper (you have it!),
-   [Dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) (three
    six-sided [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and
    one twenty-sided die per player),
-   Stationery (pencil, eraser, paper, and notebook),
-   A vivid imagination!

Optional Extras:

-   A Delving Deeper player character record sheet,
-   Graph paper for mapping
    [dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon),
-   Hexagonal paper for mapping
    [wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
    regions,
-   Additional [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
    (any number of six-sided and twenty-sided
    [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) with the
    latter optionally marked 0-9 twice),
-   Miniatures to represent the player character and his entourage,
-   An enterprising plan...

#### The Dice

Delving Deeper players require six- and twenty-sided dice. A few will do
but play will be quicker with half a dozen (or more) of each. For a
genuine retro feel twenty-sided dice can be marked 0-9 twice, with 0
representing ten and one of the two 0-9 series being identified as
adding ten.

### Preparation for Play

A player should initially learn something about the [campaign
world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) from the
referee. This information may be sketchy or generous depending on how
prepared the referee is and how many players have come before. In either
case it is the player’s role to insert his new character into the
fantasy [world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world)
and augment it with his presence. Whether he comes to riches or ruin,
each character should be noted!

Before choosing a character the player should familiarize himself with
the options presented herein. He may desire to play a certain type of
character from the outset but should be equally prepared to go with
whatever the [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) may
bring.

If the [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
occasionally seem unkind the player is reminded that great enjoyment can
arise from unconventional characters and from dramatic demises. Such
will be the fate of many adventurers.

The player should be ready to participate in the game, tackling the
challenges presented with creativity and imagination—this is the greater
part of the game. Above all the player must be prepared to accept the
rulings of the referee and to enjoy whatever game circumstances may
arise.

The adventure begins... Now!

## Player Characters

Having learned something about the [campaign
world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) from the
referee, the player’s first order of business is to construct a fantasy
persona called a character. The player will thereafter control this
character’s actions in the game.

### Alignment

Each character must choose a side in the eternal struggle. He is either
of law or of chaos or is otherwise neutral.

Law is civility and order and upholds the greater good. Chaos is anarchy
and brutality and undermines the greater good. Neutrality is neither for
law nor chaos but for the individual and for those with no stake in the
grander contest.

### Determination of Abilities

Characters are ranked in six
[abilities](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities):
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength),
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence),
[wisdom](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wisdom),
[dexterity](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dexterity),
[constitution](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#constitution), and
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma). Each is
determined, in order, by the referee with a throw of three six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) producing scores
between 3 and 18. The player should record these figures on a character
sheet or note paper before selecting his
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).

### Prime Requisite Abilities

One of the six
[abilities](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
is considered to be the prime requisite for each
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) of character.
[Fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) should be
strong,
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) should
be intelligent, and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) should be
wise.

A character will acquire a greater or lesser number of [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) from his
adventures according to his prime requisite
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
score.

| Prime     | Experience |
|-----------|------------|
| Requisite | Adjustment |
| 3-5       | −20%       |
| 6-8       | −10%       |
| 9-12      | .          |
| 13-15     | +5%        |
| 16-18     | +10%       |

Table 1.1 Experience Earned

While a high score may predispose a player toward a particular
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) and a low score may
dissuade him,
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
scores do not preclude the selection of any
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes). Nor do they
determine a character’s success (player strategy being paramount in
that).

Suppose, for example, an intending player was given these
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
scores:

|              |     |     |              |     |
|--------------|-----|-----|--------------|-----|
| Strength     | 11  |     | Dexterity    | 10  |
| Intelligence | 14  |     | Constitution | 12  |
| Wisdom       | 6   |     | Charisma     | 9   |

With a [wisdom](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wisdom) score of 6
this character would advance slowly as a
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric). His keen
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence) means
he could do well as a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user);
however, because of a preconceived inclination toward
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), the player elects
the role of a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter). His
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) of 11 is
perfectly respectable and his
[constitution](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#constitution) of 12
indicates good fitness. A
[dexterity](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dexterity) score of 10
is neither quick nor slow, but his ordinary
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma) score means
this player should not depend overly on the
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) of his
followers.

### Explanation of Abilities

Following is an explanation of each of the six abilities.

##### Strength

is raw physical power. It is useful for forcing
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors), lifting gates, and
carrying heavy
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment) including
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)! Strength is
the [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
for [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter).

| Strength                                                                    | Damage | Open  | Movement Rates Allowed by Load |        |        |        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Score                                                                       | Adj.\* | Doors | 12"                            | 9"     | 6"     | 3"     |
| 3-6                                                                         | .      | 6     | 50 lb                          | 75 lb  | 100 lb | 150 lb |
| 7-14                                                                        | .      | 5-6   | 75 lb                          | 100 lb | 150 lb | 225 lb |
| 15-18                                                                       | +1     | 5-6   | 100 lb                         | 150 lb | 200 lb | 300 lb |
| \* Damage adjustment is applicable to fighters in hand to hand combat only. |        |       |                                |        |        |        |

Table 1.2 Strength Adjustments

##### Movement Rates

allowed by load are for
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized and
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-like types. These should
be scaled appropriately for other types but any character reduced to
half his
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) rate
is considered to be encumbered.
[Movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
rates are expressed in inches which are scaled according to the
environment being explored to produce the actual ground rate.

##### Intelligence

is cunning, acumen, and book learning and one additional
[language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages) is known
for every point beyond 10. Intelligence is the [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
for [magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
and is useful to the referee for determining what course of action a
non-player character should take.

##### Many Languages

are spoken throughout the game
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) with each
intelligent type having its own tongue.
[Man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) also share a
“common tongue” which 20% of all speaking creatures will know.

| Intelligence | Languages |
|--------------|-----------|
| Score        | Known     |
| 3-10         | 2         |
| 11           | 3         |
| 12           | 4         |

Table 1.3 Languages Known

Additionally, there are the tongues of law, chaos, and neutrality which
are known to the speaking membership of those
[alignments](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment). Creatures
of one [alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) will
recognize the other
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) tongues
without comprehending them. Chaotics will attack speakers of law and
vice versa.

Player characters always know at least two languages: the common tongue
and an [alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)
tongue. Non-human player characters may know additional languages as
will all characters with above average
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence).
Additionally, there are
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
magic items that will aid in the comprehension of unknown languages.

##### Wisdom

is intuition, common sense, and maturity. Each 2 points of wisdom beyond
10 will add 1 point to the character’s [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
for the purpose of calculating [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) earned.
Wisdom is the [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
for [clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) and
functions as does
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence) in
determining what course of action a non-player character should take.

##### Dexterity

is reaction speed, coordination, and agility. It is useful for accurate
shooting and for quick reflexes when
[initiative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#initiative) is in
question. Dexterity is the [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
for
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used).

| Dexterity | Initiative | To Hit Adj.   |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Score     | Adj.       | with Missiles |
| 3-6       | −1         | −1            |

| 15-18     | +1         | +1            |

Table 1.4 Dexterity Adjustments

##### Constitution

is vim, fitness, and toughness. It determines what
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) can be endured and
whether or not a character can withstand being raised from the dead,
[polymorphed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#baleful-polymorph), or
petrified.

##### Shock Survival

is the probability that a character will survive the greatest physical
ordeals. This check is required to be raised from the dead (any failed
attempt indicates that no subsequent attempt can ever succeed), to
survive returning to flesh after being turned to stone, and to survive
transformation into another shape by the [baleful
polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#baleful-polymorph) spell.

##### Charisma

is comeliness, personal charm, and social influence. It is useful in
determining
[reactions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks),
in negotiations, and for attracting
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) into service.
It determines the number of
[retainers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) a character
can have and the
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) of any
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings).

| Charisma | Maximum   | Loyalty | Reaction |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|

Table 1.6 Charisma Adjustments

### Classes

Having been given
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
scores the player must select a class. Characters begin at the 1st level
in the chosen class and thereafter advance to successive experience
levels by returning to a safe haven after accumulating the necessary
number of [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points).

##### The numbers of hit dice

given on the following charts are always six-sided and are thrown to
determine the number of hit points of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) that can be
sustained before death. Hit
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) are thrown and
summed with any additions being added to the total.

The figures given for each [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) category are
those required on a twenty-sided die to avert various calamities.

##### Experience Points

(XP) are earned primarily by recovering (not merely finding)
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures). 1 XP is
awarded per gold piece worth of
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) recovered
though the division of any such riches, and hence any XP, is entirely up
to the players.

Experience points are also earned by defeating
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). 100 XP are
awarded for each [hit die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice)
of each enemy defeated. The referee may increase the base award for
especially dangerous enemies including those with
[poisonous](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison), paralyzing, or
multiple attacks.

Experience awards for defeating
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) are scaled
according to the ratio of the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level to the character level so that higher level players are encouraged
to seek appropriate challenges. If a party of 1st level characters were
to defeat a dozen 1 HD [orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs)
on the 1st
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level they would be awarded 1,200 XP between them. If a party of 6th
level characters defeated the same
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) they would earn
one-sixth as many XP because they are 6th level characters exploring the
1st [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level.

Note that no character can advance more than a single experience level
in a single adventure. He will always fall at least 1 XP short of
gaining a second experience level with any excess XP discarded.

### The Cleric

Clerics must choose law or chaos; they cannot remain neutral in the
eternal struggle. Either type must remain steadfast in this choice or be
stripped of his status.

Clerics of the lawful sort are virtuous knights and templars whose
purpose is to vanquish evil. Their conviction in the righteousness of
this mission enables them to [turn the
undead](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turning-the-undead) and to
invoke miracles. In performing their duty clerics are allowed
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and any
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) but the
use of edged or piercing weapons is forbidden.

Table 1.8 Cleric Progression

A cleric begins play with a [spell
book](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-books) containing the
1st level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
can thereafter
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory) a
number of
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) each
day appropriate for his experience level. So long as he adheres to his
faith a cleric will gain access to
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of
successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of
his own besides.

When a cleric achieves 9th level he can establish a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) and the
religious fervor of the workforce will reduce any construction costs by
half. Once established, a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) will
attract a body of 50-300 fanatically loyal
[dervishes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-dervishes) who will
serve without payment (the referee will determine the exact composition
of this force). If the surrounding countryside is kept clear of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) this holding
will attract faithful settlers each of whom can pay 2 gp in tithes and
taxes per month.

#### Turning the Undead

Mindless undead need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
and cannot be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue) but
all the undead are subject to being turned away—or even destroyed
utterly—by a faithful cleric who forcefully presents a Cross. Turning
the undead is accomplished by throwing two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and comparing the
result to the following table.

Should a cleric fail to turn an undead
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) he cannot
attempt to turn that
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) again until
sunrise.

#### The Anti-Cleric

Clerics of the chaotic sort are called anti-clerics. They are intended
as villains and their purpose is to vanquish good. They cannot [turn the
undead](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turning-the-undead) but have
a selection of reversed clerical
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
which they can employ with impunity. Otherwise, they function as do
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) except that an
anti-cleric
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) will
attract [zealots](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-zealots)
rather than
[dervishes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-dervishes).

### The Fighter

Fighters are soldiers, champions, and other warriors who engage in
toe-to-toe and
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). Of all the
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) they are the most
formidable in attack and can withstand the most
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). A fighter has the
use of any
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and all
weaponry, including
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) and
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears). Moreover, [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) and the
majority of other enchanted weapons are usable exclusively by them.

| A fighter requires 240,000 experience points per level beyond the 12th. |            |      |                     |       |               |        |        |
| A fighter adds one hit die per two levels beyond the 9th.               |            |      |                     |       |               |        |        |

In [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) versus
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) a
fighter throws one attack roll as a 1st level fighter for each of his
own [hit die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice). Starting at
4th level he adds +1 to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks of any troops he leads in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), and he will not be
targeted by
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) while
there are [normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
targets available.

At 8th level and above a fighter is aware of invisible opponents within
3" and [normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
require a positive
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check to stand their ground if he charges them. He is unable to
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells),
however, and has a limited selection of other magical items.

When a fighter achieves 9th level he can establish a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) and
declare himself its Lord. If the surrounding countryside is kept clear
of [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) this
holding will attract settlers each of whom can pay 1 gp in taxes per
month.

### The Magic-User

Magic-users are potentially the most powerful
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) but they are also
the most vulnerable; they can wear no
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and can
use only [daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) and
[staves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) as
weapons. A magic-user can, however,
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells). He
begins play with a [spell
book](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-books) containing the
1st level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
can
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory) a
number of
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) from
memory each day appropriate for his experience level. He gains access to
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of
successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise his
own [spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
besides.

A magic-user has use of the greatest selection of enchanted items. All
save for arms (other than
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) and
[staves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands)),
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), and a
handful of clerical items are at his disposal. Should these prove
insufficient a magic-user of at least 9th level can
[enchant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#enchanting-magic-items)
items of his own. The cost and time required to
[enchant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#enchanting-magic-items) an
item will be commensurate with its value.

##### Halflings

can be [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) but
are limited to 4th level. They are deadly accurate with hurled
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) adjusting
attack rolls by +3, and will identify noises when
[listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) at
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) with a throw of 5-6
on a six-sided die. They are nearly invisible when they blend into the
background and can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) almost
silently. Despite their diminutive stature halflings are surprisingly
resilient and make all [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) at four
levels higher than their actual level.

##### Dwarfs

dwell underground and see equally well by day or by night. They are
limited to 6th level as
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) but make all
[saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) at
four levels above their actual level and are the only characters able to
employ the +3 [war
hammer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#war-hammers) to its full
potential. They are adept at evading large, clumsy enemies and suffer
only half [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) from foes
such as [ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres) and
[giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants).

Dwarfs are expert miners and are able to note any new constructions,
[shifting walls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shifting-walls),
slopes, falling slabs, false floors and the like in
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
stonework. They will identify noises when
[listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) at
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) with a throw of 5-6
on a six-sided die.

Dwarfs are able to speak the
[languages](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages) of
[gnomes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gnomes),
[goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins), and
[kobolds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#kobolds) in addition to
their own
[language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages), their
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) tongue, and
the common tongue.

##### Elves

begin as either
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) or
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) but
can [change class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#changing-class)
between adventures as often as desired. An elf becomes dual-classed when
he changes [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) for the
first time and may thereafter use both the weaponry of a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and the
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
simultaneously.

The dual-classed character must maintain separate [experience
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) totals for
each of his [classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes), with
all earned experience going toward his currently active
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes). He uses the more
favorable game statistics of both
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) during play but
cannot act as a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) while
wearing non-magical
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).

Elves deal +1 [hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) when employing
magic weapons and can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) and fire
a [bow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) without penalty when
on foot. They are nearly invisible in their gray-green cloaks and can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) almost
silently. When actively
[searching](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#searching) they will
locate [secret doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors)
with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. When merely passing by they will
do so with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. They will identify noises
when [listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) at
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) with a throw of 5-6
on a six-sided die and are immune to the paralyzing touch of
[ghouls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ghouls) and
[thulls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#thulls). They are, however,
limited to 4th level as
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and to 8th
level as
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user).

Elves are able to speak the
[languages](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages) of
[gnolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gnolls),
[hobgoblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hobgoblins), and
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) as well as their own
[language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages), their
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) tongue, and
the common tongue.

### The Thief (Optional Class)

Thieves are sneaks, trouble-shooters, and infiltrators who operate by
cunning and subtlety. [Men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men),
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1),
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1), and
[halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1) can advance
without limitation but because thieves are necessarily underhanded they
cannot be aligned with law.
[Dexterity](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dexterity) is their
[prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities).

Although able to employ
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers), slings, and
[short swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#short-swords) thieves
lack the resilience of proper
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and can wear
leather [armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields)
only. Furthermore, a thief is best suited to striking from behind with
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise). In these
circumstances a +4 adjustment is applied to the attack roll and a
successful attack will cause two
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) at levels 1-4,
four [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) at levels 5-10,
and six [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) at levels 11-12.

This aside, a thief is especially skilled in many subterfuges including:

-   Opening locks and foiling of magical closures,
-   Disarming small trapped devices such as spring-loaded
    [poisoned](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison_1) needles,
-   Climbing almost sheer surfaces up or down at half normal [movement
    rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1),
-   Identifying noises behind closed
    [doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors),
-   Stealing or concealing items by sleight-of-hand,
-   Moving stealthily to pass or
    [surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) enemies,
-   Hiding in nothing more than shadows,
-   Finding hidden or [secret
    doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors) and
    passages.

A thief accomplishes all these with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die.
Should he fail to disarm a
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) it will
instead be sprung with all the usual consequences.

At 3rd level and above a thief is equally able to discern the meaning of
any non-magical cipher, message, map, or other written instruction. At
9th level and above this ability extends to
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) from
[scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls).

### Changing Class

Even if the referee allows
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) changes no
character can ever change
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) during an
adventure, nor can a
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) ever change to
a [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
vice versa. Human characters require a minimum score of 16 in the [prime
requisite](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#prime-requisite-abilities)
of the [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) they intend
to change to. Non-human characters have no such requirement.

A character becomes dual-classed when he changes
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) for the first time
and thereafter enjoys the benefits of both
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) simultaneously. A
dual-classed [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) is
always restricted in his choice of weaponry and a dual-classed
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) (other
than an [elf](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1), who may act
as a [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
while wearing magical
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields)) must
always go unarmored. A dual-classed
[thief](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used) is always restricted to leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).

The player of a dual-classed character must maintain separate
[experience
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) totals for
each of his [classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).
Experience is only ever earned toward one
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) at a time, as
elected by the player at the beginning of each adventure. A dual-classed
character may change
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) (for the purpose of
allocating [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points)) at any
time, subject to the aforementioned restrictions. The more favorable
game statistics of his
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) are used during
play.

### Other Classes

The [classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) herein will
provide many challenges for beginners and experts alike but are by no
means exhaustive. There is no reason why a player could not play a noble
[centaur](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#centaurs), a cunning
[lizardman](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizardmen), or any other
type of character should the referee permit it. Whatever these other
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) may be, the
referee should ensure that they start out relatively weak and have scope
to advance in power as do the other
[classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).

### Beyond Level 12

There is no reason a human character cannot rise beyond 12th level. If
higher level play is desired from the outset players should consider the
limitations of non-human characters carefully before selecting them.
When players progress beyond 12th level the referee can extrapolate
spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
progressions from the existing charts and may wish to introduce higher
level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
[abilities](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
for each [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).

If higher level play is not desired characters can be retired after 12th
level, becoming political figures in the
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) under the
referee’s stewardship. The player is then free to create a new character
to play.

## Non-Player Characters

### Hirelings

Characters will likely require the services of hired help. Hirelings of
various sorts can be found in towns, cities, and possibly in villages.
Hirelings are ordinary [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)
including guides, messengers, porters, and torch bearers who will
perform mundane duties for
[upkeep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cost-of-upkeep) plus a fee
of 2 gp per month or 2 sp per day. With enough gold there is no limit to
how many hirelings a character can employ.

### Mercenaries

While ordinary
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) can be had
for [upkeep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cost-of-upkeep) plus 2
gp per month
[mercenaries](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-mercenaries) are
another matter. These are neutrally aligned soldiers whose monthly fee
is commensurate with their function and
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment).

Monthly fees are in addition to the cost of
[upkeep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cost-of-upkeep).

Footmen are equipped with leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and
armored footmen with mail
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and

[Missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire)
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) have leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) only.
Horsemen always have mounts in addition.

[Elf](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) and
[dwarf](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1) mercenaries are
uncommon and [orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) are
employable by chaotics only; otherwise, these can be hired at towns or
[strongholds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds), or
wherever else they are encamped. With enough gold there is no limit to
the number of mercenaries a character can employ.

### Retainers

More unusual help including
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) and player
types can also be sought. These are called retainers and the number
allowed at any one time is limited by a character’s
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma) score.

A character can seek retainers during his adventures or advertise his
need by posting notices, hiring heralds, frequenting taverns, or sending
emissaries to foreign lands where likely candidates are known to dwell.
The cost and effectiveness of these endeavors is left to the referee’s
discretion.

If a prospective retainer is located the character can make an offer of
employment. Only the lowest level player types will be seeking
employment and these will not be tempted for any offer worth less than
100 gp. [Dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1) desire
especially gold, [elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1)
and [magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desire
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
magic items, [clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
desire crusades and places to worship, and so on.

### Enlisting Monsters

Characters can enlist
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) of the same
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) by regular
negotiation. Others (including higher level player types) can be pressed
into service by coercion with a charm spell or by physical
[subdual](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).

Magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
notwithstanding, some incentive must be offered to entice a
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) into service.
The character should decide what he believes would be useful or valuable
to the [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) and
make his offer (merely sparing its life is insufficient). The
[monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
will be determined by the referee and adjusted according to the offer
and the character’s
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma). A character
can attempt a richer offer only if the
[monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
is “uncertain”.

#### Retainer Loyalty

When a [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) or
non-player character enters into a player character’s service the
referee will secretly determine his loyalty, which may subsequently be
adjusted for excellent or poor treatment. Additional pay, gifts of arms,
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), or magic
items, and the rising fame (or infamy) of an employer can increase
loyalty. Unjust treatment, poor prospects, or unfit conditions can
decrease loyalty.

So long as a [retainer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers)
is treated reasonably, receives the agreed payment, and is not exposed
to unnecessary danger his loyalty will not be tested. In extreme
circumstances, however, the referee will use
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks or
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks to determine how a
[retainer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) will behave.

### Reaction and Morale Checks

When required, reaction and morale checks are made by the referee with a
throw of two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and are adjusted
for [loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty). A
high result indicates a positive reaction or good morale and a low
result indicates a negative reaction or poor morale.

Retainers will obey orders to the best of their ability so long as their
morale holds. A poor morale check can result in refusal to perform;
exactly how this plays out is left to the referee’s discretion. It could
result in dissension, refusal to undertake a task or join
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), withdrawal from
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), desertion,
surrender to the enemy, complete rout, and so on.

Excepting unintelligent
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (who never
check morale) most enemies are also subject to failures of morale.

### Relatives

Player characters possess arms,
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), and
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment) from the
outset and—if they are fortunate—can accumulate considerable wealth
during their adventures. Thus a character is permitted to name an heir
to his estate should he meet an untimely end. If he should mysteriously
vanish “death” can be declared after 30 days of unexplained absence.

Once death has been established all worldly possessions are passed to
the designated heir, if there is one, or else to the realm if there is
not. Should there be an heir he takes possession of all properties,
goods, and valuables that belonged to the departed less a 10%
inheritance tax which is payable to the realm. The realm may also
enforce payment of a bond to any
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) and
[retainers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers), guaranteeing
the return of their possessions and any accrued pay to their families.

Should the character unexpectedly return to reclaim his estate the
inheritance tax will be payable again. The referee will adjudicate the
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
of the disinherited heir who might intrigue to retain control of the
estate. In any case, his
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) will
suffer a 0 to −5 adjustment (one six-sided die −1) if he is kept on as
part of the character’s household or retinue.

### Cost of Upkeep

While dwelling in a village, town, or city a character must pay upkeep
for himself and his entourage. At its simplest the cost of upkeep for
middling quarters and fare is 1 gp per month per 100 [experience
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#experience-points) the
character has.

A character who desires fine cuisine and luxurious accommodation must
consent to pay higher costs, varying with extravagance. Alternatively,
the referee may require players to itemize individual expenses.

The cost of upkeep is payable only so long as the character maintains
urban living arrangements. Living off the land incurs no costs and thus
payments cease when the character journeys to a
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
area. When he builds a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) of his own
he may collect taxes from its inhabitants to help cover his costs.

## Equipment

Each player begins with 30-180 gold pieces to furnish his character with
equipment appropriate to his profession and possible adventures.

Note that 20 coins of any type weigh one pound.

## Magic

A [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can memorize a
number of
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) each
day according to his experience level. He must be fresh and rested and
have access to the appropriate [spell
books](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-books) to memorize any
spell therein. Bereft of his [spell
books](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-books) he cannot
memorize any
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)!

### Spell Casting from Memory

A memorized spell can be cast at any time but once it has been cast it
is erased from memory. Once erased a spell cannot be cast again until it
is memorized the following day. Notwithstanding this limitation, nothing
prevents a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) from memorizing
the same spell several times.

In order to invoke a spell the caster must be free to concentrate,
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) his arms
and hands, speak aloud, and see the target. To do so during
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) the player must
declare his [intent](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intent) at the
beginning of the [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).
Casting a spell requires the full
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) so no other action may
be attempted. Furthermore, if the caster is struck by any
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire), blow, or
spell before his own invocation is completed it will be foiled and
erased from memory without being triggered. The referee will adjudicate
whether other interruptions are sufficient to foil a spell.

### Spell Casting from Scrolls

A [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory) a
spell of any spell level directly from a
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls).
Unless the
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls) was
penned by his own hand a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) must
employ a [read magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#read-magic)
spell before he can read a [spell
scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls). Thereafter,
either [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes) can read a
[spell scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls)
without memorizing the spell in advance.
[Casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
a spell from a
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls)
invokes the magic at the minimum caster level necessary to memorize the
spell and simultaneously erases the spell from the
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls).

### Reversible Spells

If a [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) spell is
noted as reversible, only a chaotic
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) can
use the reverse form and only a lawful
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can use the
proper form. If a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) spell
is noted as reversible, the reverse form is a separate spell which can
be memorized,
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory),
and written to a
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls)
exactly as per any other spell.

### Spell Books

Magic-users and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) begin play
with a book of 1st level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) but
must find, buy, or
[research](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#researching-new-spells)
higher level spell books thereafter.

Adventuring is a dangerous business so a spell caster may wish to
construct a duplicate spell book to carry without risk to his primary
resource. Should a spell book be
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost), damaged, or
destroyed in any event it can be replaced at a cost. A book of 1st level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
costs 2,000 gp, a book of 2nd level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
costs 4,000 gp, a book of 3rd level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
costs 8,000 gp, and so on.

### Creating Spell Scrolls

Magic-users and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can copy
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
which they can memorize onto
[scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls).
It takes one week to create any [spell
scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls) and costs 100
gp per spell level. Thus, a 4th level [spell
scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls) takes one
week to construct at a cost of 400 gp. A [spell
scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls) can be
invoked only once and is at risk of being ruined by rain, fire, and
other
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
hazards.

### Researching New Spells

Clerics and
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
research new
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) for
their repertoires. The spell level of a new spell cannot exceed that
which the researcher is able to memorize. Otherwise, the player can
contrive whatever spell he desires, remembering that the referee will
determine what is allowable and the spell level of the new magic.

Success is a matter of time and investment. One week and 2,000 gp are
required for a 1st level spell. Costs double and time is extended by one
week at each successively higher spell level. Thus, a 2nd level spell
requires two weeks and 4,000 gp, a 3rd level spell requires three weeks
and 8,000 gp, a 4th level spell requires four weeks and 16,000 gp and so
on.

### Cumulative Magic

Spells and other magical effects will usually combine safely with one
another. However, multiple enchantments with the same effect are not
cumulative; only the single, most powerful effect applies.

##### Cure Light Wounds

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: 1 creature, range: touch) The
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can restore 2-7
[lost hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) to
any one creature (including himself) after one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of aid. [Hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
cannot be raised beyond the creature’s normal total. The reverse, cause
light wounds, will cause 2-7 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) at a touch,
possibly requiring an attack roll to touch an unwilling target.

##### Detect Evil

(affects: self, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 12") The
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can sense the

within range, as well as any
[curse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses) or malicious
enchantment upon an object or place.

##### Detect Magic

(affects: self, duration: 2
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 6") The

[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) + 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)/level, range: 12")
Causes an object or volume of
[space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required) to be lit as
if by torchlight, illuminating a 3" diameter. The reverse, darkness,

creatures that see in the dark and to the

not to the [true
seeing](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#true-seeing) spell.

##### Protection from Evil

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: self, duration: 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) This spell prevents
any enchanted or conjured creature from contacting the

chaotic types will be at −2 to hit and the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) will make
[saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) at
+2. The reverse, protection from good, applies equally to enchanted or

sunlight are dazzled but otherwise unharmed. [Continuous
light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#continuous-light) is
permanent unless dispelled. The reverse, continuous darkness, creates a
permanent, 24" diameter sphere of darkness that is impenetrable even to
creatures that see in the dark and to the

throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus

check. The animals will not attack the

duration, regardless of their

but will perform a favor or service only if the

[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) at a touch,
possibly requiring an attack roll to touch an unwilling target.

##### Enervate Dead

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: 4-48 undead, duration: 7-12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 12")

#### 5th Level Cleric Spells

##### Commune

(affects: self, duration: special) The
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) seeks divinely
given knowledge. The Gods, or their agents, will entertain 1-6 questions
with a simple “yes” or “no” answer which will be absolute. Use of this
spell is limited to once per adventure, or even more infrequently, for
the Gods dislike frequent interruptions. However, on the most
[Holy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#holy) day of the year three
six-sided [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) are
thrown with the highest result being the number of questions that will
be answered.

##### Dispel Evil

affects: 1 enchantment, duration: permanent, range: 3") Immediately
dismisses all enchanted or conjured creatures and
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses) or enchantments of

[elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals), and
[invisible
stalkers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-invisible-stalker) are
sent back to their origin. All
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses) and malign
enchantments within 3" are affected as if by a [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic). The reverse,
dispel good, functions against enchanted or conjured creatures and
enchantments of the benign sort.

##### Insect Plague

(affects: 40" diameter, duration: 1 day, range: 48") Conjures a vast, 4"
deep swarm of crawling, creeping, and flying insects which
[moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at 6"
in a direction indicated by the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) or remains
stationary. The swarm obscures vision, impedes
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2), and
devours all organic material including crops. Smoke, fire, or extreme
cold will temporarily delay or divert the swarm but not destroy it.
[Normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) will
automatically flee but those caught in the plague will suffer
innumerable bites and stings amounting to 1 point of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), regardless of
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields). Misuse
of this spell will cause a
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) to immediately
become an
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric).

##### Quest

(affects: 1 subject, duration: special, range: 3") The subject is
compelled to perform a quest specified by the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric). Upon bestowing
a quest the [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
also specifies a [curse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses).
Should the subject dally or deviate from his quest he will be afflicted
by the [curse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses) until he
resumes the quest. Only the completion of the quest or a successful
[dispel evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil) (or
dispel good) will end this spell. Note that a lawful
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) must specify
only lawful quests and
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses).

##### Raise Dead

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: 1 person, duration: permanent, range: touch) Restores life to a
deceased [man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) who
has not been dead any longer than one day per level of the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric). Rising from
the dead is a great ordeal and the subject must make a successful [shock
survival](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shock-survival) check in
order to be raised. Should this check succeed he returns to life but
requires two weeks of recuperation. The reverse, finger of death, causes
a baleful ray to issue from the
[anti-cleric’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric)
pointed finger to any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) within sight
and 12" range. If the target makes a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays) the effect is
negated; otherwise, he dies instantly.

##### True Seeing

(affects: self, duration: 11-16
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) The
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) sees all things
as they actually are. Blindness and darkness (even the magical sort) are
defeated. [Traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps),
[secret doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors),
invisible creatures, and hidden object are plainly seen.
[Illusions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions) and charms
are immediately discerned as is the true nature of any
[polymorphed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#baleful-polymorph),
petrified, or transmuted creature or object.

#### 1st Level Magic-User Spells

##### Alter Self

(affects: self, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) + 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)/level) The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
assume the appearance of any creature of the same general size and shape
as himself. He could appear to be a town guard, a beautiful maiden, or a
[gnoll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gnolls) but not a
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) or a
[wyvern](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wyverns).

##### Charm Person

(affects: 1 person, duration: special, range: 12") Brings a single
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) who fails to
save [versus spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell)
completely under the influence of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user). Gross
abuse or negligence allows the
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) another
[saving throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws);
otherwise, the charm lasts until it is lifted by the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
dispelled.

##### Color Spray

(affects: 12" arc, duration: 2-12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) 2-7 seeing creatures
are rendered unconscious by a dazzling glare of clashing colors. Those
nearest to the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) are
always affected first, sheltering those farther back.
[Heroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) are
allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) to negate the effect
and
[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
are unaffected.

##### Comprehend Languages

(affects: self, duration: special) Enables the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) to read
any [language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages),
cipher, message, map, or other written instruction excepting magical
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) or

one longer one, but no power to speak or
[listen](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) is conferred.

##### Detect Magic

(affects: self, duration: 2
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 6") The

concentrates on maintaining it. The fog wall is 20ft thick and up to 6"
long and 20ft high (or any equivalent dimensions) and is straight or
curved as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires. It is impenetrable to sight.

##### Gazeback

(affects: self, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) The
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) eyes
become mirrored granting him immunity to dazzling and gaze attacks
without impairing his sight. The gaze attacks of
[basilisks](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#basilisks),
[medusae](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#medusae), and
[vampires](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vampires), the [mirror of
life
trapping](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mirror-of-life-trapping),
and the [color spray](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#color-spray)
spell are all defeated. Moreover, any gaze attack attempted within 3"

into a mirror.

[window](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#window), shutter, or other

then be opened only by a magic-using creature with at least 7 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice), a
[knock](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#knock) spell, a [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic), or a

(if these are used).

##### Light

[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) This spell prevents
any enchanted or conjured creature from contacting the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user).
Furthermore, attacks made against the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) by
other chaotic types will be at −2 to hit and the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) will
make [saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws)
at +2.

##### Read Magic

in [spell books](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-books), or
magical inscriptions or command words on other objects. The spell lasts
long enough to comprehend two short writings or one longer one.
[Spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
written by other
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) are
incomprehensible without the use of this spell.

up to 4+1 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) to
fall into a fitful slumber. The magic is indiscriminate and must affect
the indicated number of creatures beginning with those nearest the
target. The magic affects only creatures that normally sleep but no
[saving throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is
allowed.

creature becomes invisible. If the subject takes overtly hostile action

seeing them.

##### Knock

(affects: portals, range: 6") Opens all known and unlocked
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors),

levitates up or down as desired at a rate of 6". The spell will not

the nearest is located. A specific unique object can only be sought by
this spell if the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) has
previously observed the object firsthand.

##### Phantasm

(affects: 3" diameter, duration: concentration, range: 24") Creates a
convincing, animated phantasm that persists for as long as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
continues to concentrate on controlling it. A [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) is allowed each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) that someone doubts
the phantasm’s veracity. A successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) enables them
to end the phantasm by purposefully touching it. Otherwise, the phantasm
is considered “real” for all purposes including causing real
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 6") The

concentrates on a specific direction for one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in order to sense what
creatures are within range in that direction. Having sensed creatures,
the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
perceive the surface thoughts of any one creature at a time,
[listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) in for as
long as desired. He can hop from creature to creature as desired,
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) by
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), unless the magic is
obstructed by lead or any rock thicker than 20ft.

##### Web

(affects: 2" diameter or 3"×1", duration: permanent, range: 3") Fills
the targeted area to 10ft depth with strong, sticky, inflammable fibers.
Creatures at the edge are allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) to avoid
entanglement but those that are wholly surrounded cannot avoid it.
[Giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) and similarly
powerful creatures can tear through the web in a single
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), as can a flaming
sword cut through its fibers.
[Ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres),
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls), and
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) with 18
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) can tear
through it in two [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) require four
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of toil to tear
through the web while lesser creatures will be held fast.

##### Witch Lock

portal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hold-portal) spell except
that a witch lock lasts indefinitely and can be placed on anything that
can be opened including chests, draws, wardrobes, flasks, books, and
portals. A [knock](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#knock) spell or
the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) who
created the witch lock can bypass it without ending the spell, as can
any other
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) at
least three levels higher than the caster.

#### 3rd Level Magic-User Spells

##### Circle of Invisibility

(affects: 1" radius, duration: special, range: 24") All creatures within

##### Dispel Magic

(affects: 1 enchantment, duration: permanent, range: 12") Ends any
ongoing spell that was begun by a caster of equal or lower level. If the
ongoing spell was begun by a higher level caster there is a 10% chance
for each level he has over and above the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) level
that the dispel magic will fail. Instantaneous
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
cannot be dispelled, nor will this spell affect magic items.

##### Fireball

(affects: 2" radius, duration: instantaneous, range: 24") The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) points
his finger at a target anywhere within range and sight and causes a
fiery explosion to fill a 2" radius, or an equivalent volume of
available [space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required)
(twelve 10ft cubes on a typical
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
map). Everyone caught within the blast suffers 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per level of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) to a
maximum of 10-60 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). A
successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus breath

this [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) by half.

The spell duration is determined secretly by the referee.

(affects: 4-24 creatures, duration: 3
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 24") 4-24
creatures within a 4" diameter are quickened. Affected creatures will
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at
double pace and, against any non-quickened creature, will always gain
[initiative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#initiative) and have a
+2 to hit adjustment. Those nearest to the target are always affected
first. At the end of the spell each affected creature must save [versus
petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification)
or else age one year. [Haste](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#haste)
counters [slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) and vice
versa.

##### Hold Person

(affects: 1 or 1-4 persons, duration: 1-6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) + 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)/level, range: 12") 1-4
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) are held
immobile if they fail a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
paralysis](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).
If a single [man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) is
targeted his [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is penalized
by −2.

##### Lightning Bolt

(affects: 6", duration: instantaneous, range: 18") Unleashes a stroke of
lightning at any target in range and sight. It passes directly through
creatures but reflects off hard surfaces, possibly even doubling back,
so that it is always 6" long; thus the maximum reach of this spell is up
to 24". Everyone passed through suffers 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per level of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) to a
maximum of 10-60 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). A
successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays) will reduce
this [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) by half.

[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 24") 4-24
creatures within a 4" diameter are slowed. Affected creatures will
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at half
pace and, against any non-slowed creature, will always lose
[initiative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#initiative) and have a
−2 to hit adjustment. Those nearest to the target are always affected
first. Slow counters [haste](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#haste)
and vice versa.

##### Water Breathing

(affects: 1 creature, duration: 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 3") The

1-6 ordinary animals within range and sight to grow to
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) size, assuming all
of the game statistics of the
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) sort. If no such
statistics are given assume that size and [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) are
doubled. The disposition of the animals toward the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) is
unaffected by this spell.

##### Animate Dead

(affects: 2-24 dead, duration: permanent, range: 3") Causes nearby bones
or bodies to rise as undead
[skeletons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#skeletons) or
[zombies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#zombies) under the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
command. 1-6 undead are animated for every three whole levels the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) has.
Thus a 7th or 8th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
animate 2-12 undead, a 9th, 10th or 11th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
animate 3-18 undead, and a 12th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can

evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil) spell.

##### Charm Monster

a single
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
that fails to save [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) completely under the
influence of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user). Gross
abuse or negligence allows the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (or
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)) an
additional [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws); otherwise,
the charm lasts until it is lifted by the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or is
dispelled.

##### Confusion

(affects: 3-18 creatures, duration: 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 12") Causes
confusion in 3-18 creatures. The magic is indiscriminate and must affect
the indicated number of creatures beginning with those nearest to the
target.
[Heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
are allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) to negate the effect;
otherwise, each individual’s behavior is determined randomly each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

range. All
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) in the
area of effect will immediately flee for six
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).
[Heroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) are
allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) to negate the effect.

##### Hallucinatory Terrain

(affects: 160" diameter, duration: special, range: 24") Creates an
illusionary terrain that conceals the underlying geography and is
convincing in every way from a
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3).
The hallucination will not stand up to close inspection, however, and
can be seen through automatically by any intelligent being who examines
it carefully from within.

##### Polymorph

(affects: self, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) + 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)/level) Transforms the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) into
any creature he desires. He assumes the size,
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength), mobility,
[armor class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee), and physical
attack and [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
capabilities of his new form, excluding supernatural
[abilities](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
such as [breath
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon), gaze
attacks, and spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory).
He retains his own
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence), [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice),
[saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws), and
ability to speak and
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

duration: permanent, range: touch) Lifts one

blazing curtain of fire which persists for as long as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
concentrates upon maintaining it. The wall of fire is 5ft thick and up
to 6" long and 20ft high (or any equivalent dimensions). It can be
straight or curved as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires, including a 10ft high 4" diameter circle. Creatures of fire are
unaffected except by its opaqueness. The wall is otherwise impenetrable
to [normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
while
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
suffer 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) for bursting
through. Creatures of cold and undead instead suffer 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). A
wall of fire and a white [dragon’s
breath](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragon-breath-weapon) (or
blast from a [wand of
ice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wand-of-ice)) will negate one
another, resulting in a double-sized [fog
wall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fog-wall).

##### Wall of Ice

(affects: 6" wall, duration: permanent, range: 12") Conjures a steaming
cold bulkhead of hard pack ice. The wall of ice is 5ft thick and up to
6" long and 20ft high (or any equivalent dimensions). It can be straight
or curved as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires, including a 10ft high 4" diameter circle. A wall of ice is
opaque and is impenetrable to
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types).
[Heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
can attempt to crash through a wall of ice as they might break down
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors). Any such attempt
causes 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) except to creatures
of cold (who are unharmed) and creatures of fire who instead suffer 2-12
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). A
wall of ice and a red [dragon’s
breath](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragon-breath-weapon) (or
[fireball](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fireball)) will negate
one another, resulting in a double-sized [fog
wall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fog-wall).

##### Witch Eye

(affects: self, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 1") Conjures
an invisible, floating eye that flies at a rate of 12" per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to anywhere the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) desires
within 24". The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can see
in his mind’s eye everything that the witch eye sees.

#### 5th Level Magic-User Spells

##### Baleful Polymorph

(affects: 1 creature, duration: permanent, range: 6") Transforms a
subject within range into any creature the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires. The subject must immediately make a [shock
survival](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shock-survival) check with
failure resulting in death. Otherwise, he assumes the size,
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength), mobility,
[armor class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee), and physical
attack and [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
capabilities of the new form including supernatural
[abilities](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
such as [breath
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) and gaze
attacks, but excluding spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory).
He retains his own
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence), [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice),
[saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws), and
ability to speak and
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells). The
transformation is permanent until dispelled.

##### Cloudkill

(affects: 3" diameter, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 1") Conjures
a 3" diameter bank of dense,
[poisonous](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) fog which rolls
along the ground at a rate of 3" either with the
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) or away from
the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user).
The vapors are heavier than air and will sink to the lowest lay of the
land, pouring down sinkholes or openings for example. Any
[normal-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) that
breathes the fog is immediately slain.
[Heroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) are
allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) to avoid death and
[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
are unaffected.

##### Contact Other Plane

(affects: self, duration: special) The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) seeks
knowledge from powerful beings on other planes of existence. These will
answer the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
questions with a “yes” or “no” answer which will be absolute. 1-6
questions (determined secretly by the referee) will be entertained
safely. For each additional question asked the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) must
make a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) or be
[feebleminded](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#feeblemind) for 1-6
weeks.

##### Feeblemind

(affects: 1 creature, duration: permanent, range: 24") One intelligent
creature within range and sight must save [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) at −4 or become a
mental invalid. A feebleminded creature can neither read, write, figure,
communicate in any coherent fashion, nor
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) or
use command words. The spell lasts until it is canceled by a [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic).

##### Hold Monster

(affects: 1 or 1-4 creatures, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) + 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)/level, range: 12") 1-4
creatures are held immobile if they fail a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
paralysis](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).
If a single creature is targeted its [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is penalized
by −2.

##### Invoke Elemental

(affects: 1 [elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals),
duration: special, range: 24") Conjures one earth, air, fire, or [water
elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-water) of the
16 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) sort.
The [elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) does the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) will
until it is destroyed in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) or is dismissed by
the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
a [dispel evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil). The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) may
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at half
rate but controlling the
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) requires the
remainder of his concentration. If he should lose concentration (by
being hit, for example) he can no longer dismiss the
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) and it will
attack him immediately. No more than one
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) of each type
can be conjured per day.

##### Magic Jar

(affects: self, duration: special, range: 3") The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) sends
his spirit into a gem, crystal, or similar
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) within 3",
leaving his own body helpless. From there the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
attempt to possess any creature that approaches within 12". He can
automatically repossess his own body but others are allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell). Should they fail
this [saving throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws)
the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
possesses them and assumes full control of their physical faculties
while retaining his own intellect. The
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
spirit can return to the magic jar at any time and automatically does so
if ever the possessed body is slain. If his own body has died in the
meanwhile he is trapped in the magic jar until another body can be
possessed. If the magic jar is destroyed while the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
spirit is resident, he is utterly annihilated and cannot be raised or
reincarnated.

##### Passwall

(affects: 1" tunnel, duration: 3
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 3") Opens a
tunnel up to 5ft in diameter and 1" deep through any wall—including
solid rock but excluding solid iron.

##### Telekinesis

(affects: 20lb/level, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 12") Any
object or objects (including living things) within sight and range whose
total mass does not exceed 20lb per level of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can be
moved by thought alone. Objects can be moved from anywhere within range
to anywhere else within range in a single
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Teleport

(affects: 1 subject, duration: instantaneous, range: touch) Instantly
transports the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) (or
other subject) from place to place regardless of
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3),
possibly requiring an attack roll to touch an unwilling subject. The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) must be
very familiar with the destination or risk an error. If he is only
passingly familiar with the destination an error will occur with a throw
of 1 on a six-sided die. If he has only seen the destination once an
error will occur with a throw of 1-2. If he has never seen the
destination an error will occur with a throw of 1-3. When an error
occurs the subject will arrive either 10-60ft too high or too low (50%
chance of either). Teleporting into mid-air results in a
[fall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#falling); teleporting into
solid earth results in death.

##### Transmute Rock to Mud

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: 30"×30" or 33" diameter, duration: 3-18 days, range: 12")
Transmutes a large area of rock or earth into a 10ft deep mud slough,
undermining structures,
[drowning](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#drowning) heavy
creatures, and otherwise reducing
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) to
3". The mud will dry after 3-18 days leaving the rock or earth in its
former state. Transmute rock to mud can be canceled immediately by a
transmute mud to rock spell and vice versa.

##### Wall of Stone

(affects: 6" wall, duration: permanent, range: 6") Conjures an imposing
bulkhead of solid stone 5ft thick and up to 6" long and 20ft high (or
any equivalent dimensions). It can be plain or featured and straight or
curved, as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires, including a 10ft high 4" diameter circle. It is impenetrable to
all but the ordinary means of tunneling or battery, except that it can
be dismissed by a [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic).

#### 6th Level Magic-User Spells

##### Anti-Magic Shield

(affects: self, duration: 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) An invisible barrier
surrounds the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) so that
no spell or spell-like effect (including charms and gaze attacks) may
pass in either direction for the duration. It is impervious even to
[dispel magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic).

##### Control Water

(affects: 1 body of water, duration: 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 24") The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) causes
the water level of a river or similar body of water within 24" of
himself to immediately fall to half its natural depth (allowing a
waterway to be forded) or to rise to half its depth again (precipitating
a flash flooding).

##### Control Weather

(affects: 1 geographic region, duration: permanent) Invokes a single
desired [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) condition
in the local geographical region the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) is in.
The [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) condition may
be extreme but must be naturally occurring. The
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) will take 1-6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to change but will
then last until dispelled.

##### Disintegrate

(affects: 1 target, range: 6") A deadly beam of darkness irrevocably
disintegrates any single non-magical object or creature. Creatures are
allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays) to avoid the
beam and negate the effect; otherwise, any inanimate matter up to 1"
cube (or any equivalent volume) can be instantaneously disintegrated.

##### Geas

(affects: 1 subject, duration: special, range: 3") The subject is
compelled to perform a
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) specified by the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user). Should
the subject dally or deviate from his
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) he will lose 1-6
points of [strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) each
day until he either dies or resumes the
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest). Only the completion
of the [quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) or a
successful [dispel
evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil) (or dispel good)
will end this spell.

##### Invoke Stalker

(affects: 1 stalker, duration: special, range 1") Conjures an [invisible
stalker](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-invisible-stalker) from
the null-dimensions which the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
instruct to carry out some task. The [invisible
stalker](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-invisible-stalker) will
perform this mission single-mindedly until the task is completed, it is
destroyed in [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), or is
dismissed by a [dispel
evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil). It will resent
this servitude, however, and if after any day of service the referee
throws a 12 on two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) the [invisible
stalker](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-invisible-stalker) will
subvert the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
[intent](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intent) by observing his
orders absolutely literally to the letter. If ordered to guard a
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) hoard, for
example, it might take the hoard to its home dimension and guard it
there.

##### Move Earth

(affects: 1 body of earth, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 24") Above
ground this spell causes a hill, ridge, bluff, or similar body of earth
within range and sight to be moved. Underground it
[moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) a
cavern, chamber, passageway, or similar feature through the ground, or
else [moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
some protuberance of earth within a large cavern. The body of earth is
moved at a gentle rate of 6". Creatures, vegetation, and structures can
be carried along unharmed or structures can be undermined, at the
referee’s discretion. Alternatively, a [clay
golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems-clay) or [earth
elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-earth) can be
driven back 12" suffering 6-36
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Note that earth is
moved but not reshaped.

##### Project Image

(affects: 1 image, duration: 6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), range: 24") Projects
a quasi-real image of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
anywhere within range and sight. The image is indistinguishable from the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and is
completely under his control. He knows everything his image senses and
can direct it to perform any action he himself could perform including
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells). The
image is impervious to harm except that a successful [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic) will end its
existence.
[Spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)

the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and
are erased from his memory as usual.

##### Reincarnation

(affects: 1 creature, duration: permanent, range: touch) Restores a
slain character to life in another body so long as he has not been dead
any longer than one day per level of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user). Rising
from the dead is a great ordeal and the subject must make a successful
[shock survival](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shock-survival)
check in order to reincarnate. Should this prove successful his body is
transformed (according to his
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)) and he
awakes without need for recuperation.

The reincarnated character retains his former
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence),
[wisdom](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wisdom), and memories but
otherwise assumes all faculties of his new form. Any former spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
ability is [lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). If
a player character [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes)
or race is indicated throw a six-sided die to determine the character’s
new level. [Elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) may
split their levels between the fighting and magic-using (and thieving,
if
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
are used) [classes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).
[Halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1) will have
only half as many levels as indicated. No character can advance in level
by [reincarnation](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reincarnation) in
any case.

##### Slaying Spell

(affects: 4-24 creatures, range: 24") Instantly slays 4-24 creatures
within a 7" diameter area. The spell is indiscriminate and must affect
the indicated number of creatures beginning with those nearest to the
target. No [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is allowed but
[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
are unaffected.

##### Stone to Flesh

([reversible](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reversible-spells),
affects: 1 creature, duration: permanent, range: 12") Restores one
petrified creature (and any possessions) to living flesh. Returning to
the flesh is a great ordeal and the subject must make a successful
[shock survival](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shock-survival)
check or else be slain. The reverse, flesh to stone, turns one living
creature (and any possessions carried) to stone. A successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification)
will negate the effect.

##### Wall of Iron

(affects: 6" wall, duration: permanent, range: 6") Conjures a daunting
bulkhead of solid iron 1ft thick and up to 6" long and 20ft high (or any
equivalent dimensions). It can be plain or featured and straight or
curved, as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
desires, including a 10ft high 4" diameter circle. It is impervious to
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) such
as [sixth sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense),
[passwall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#passwall), and [transmute
rock to mud](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#transmute-rock-to-mud)
and is largely impenetrable to ordinary means of battery or attack. It
can be dismissed by a successful [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic).

# Section II: Delving & Exploration

## Preparation for the Campaign

The referee should be comfortable with these rules and the mechanics of
play, but even then a new
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) requires
some preparation before play can start. The referee begins by envisaging
a fantasy [world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world)
in which his new
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) will take
place. He need not etch out the entire history of the
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world)
immediately; the merest hint of what the
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) might
promise is sufficient at this early stage. Next, he requires the outline
of a continent or similar region for the players to explore. Finally, he
requires a detailed map of a town or village and the countryside in
which play will begin.

The referee should familiarize himself with the geography, water
sources, and
[settlements](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#settlements-and-strongholds_1)
(human and otherwise) near to the start of play, noting any particular
detail of each. Using broad strokes rather than exacting detail will
save time and allow room for the players to influence the
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world),
encouraging a dynamic
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) that feels
“alive”.

After establishing the [campaign
world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) the referee
should map several
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)
[dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) and
stock these with
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
[treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), and magical
items. Once these
[dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) are
created the referee should mark them on his map somewhere in the
vicinity of the start of play. The
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) is then
ready and the players can begin exploring the fantasy milieu in which
they find themselves.

### The Referee’s Supplies

In addition to those supplies recommended for players the referee should
furnish himself with the following:

#### The Essentials:

-   Delving Deeper (you have it!),
-   Polyhedral [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
    (two pair of six-sided
    [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and one pair
    each of four-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided
    [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)),
-   A [campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) log
    or notebook to [keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep)
    track of characters, places,
    [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
    non-player characters and
    [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2), and
    [treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures),
-   A [campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign)
    calendar for timekeeping,
-   A creative mind and the ability to “run the show”.

#### Optional Extras:

-   Additional [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
    (with twenty-sided
    [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) optionally
    marked 0-9 twice),
-   Additional miniatures to represent
    [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
-   [Scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) models or maps of
    [dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
    and
    [wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
    environs,
-   [Mass battles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mass-battles)
    rules such as Chainmail, De Bellis Fantasticus, Book of War, or
    similar.

## Creating a World

The referee begins by creating a map of the world on a sheet of hex
paper. This map need not be extensive as exploration of the unknown is a
desired element of the
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign). It must,
however, remain unknown to the players.

Each hex should be 6 miles wide on this map such that an unencumbered
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) afoot can cover two hexes
per day of good hiking and an encumbered
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can cover one hex per
day.

The referee should note at least one civilized
[settlement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#settlements-and-strongholds_1)
(the village, town, or
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) where play
will begin) near the center of his map. He should then add any
immediately surrounding features including other villages, nearby towns,
a [keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep), a ruin, caves, a
forest, a swamp, and so on. The referee should name each feature and
decide whether it is abandoned or inhabited, and (if so) by whom?
Denizens might be ordinary lawful folk,
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1),
[bandits](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-bandits), a knight and
his entourage, [orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs),
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls), an evil high
priest, and so on. Thus the game world begins to take shape.

### The Start of Play

Play should commence in a (relatively) safe haven such as a town,
village, or
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds). Towns are
busy regional centers, home to 1,000-6,000 folk from all walks of life
including many itinerants. Villages are quiet, agrarian communities of
100-400 farming folk.
[Strongholds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) are
occupied by bodies of 30-180 soldiery along with a prominent leader and
his supporting entourage. Wherever they begin, players should be able to
acquire their starting goods and
[rumors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#legend-and-rumors) of
possible adventures.

#### Legend and Rumors

The players might already know some of the
[campaign’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) cultural
folklore. Other tales and local legends can be devised by the referee
and learned by the players as required.

The arrival or formation of a company of armed adventurers will not go
unnoticed and, unless the players take pains to conceal their purpose,
rumors will quickly spread. The players may, of course, desire to
advertise their presence in order to gain employment.

Obtaining news and rumors is thereafter a matter of visiting local inns
and common rooms where a liberal round of drinks worth 10-60 gp will
usually get tongues wagging, or where an earnest barkeep might be
willing to help for 1-6 gp. Misinformation may be learned at the
referee’s discretion.

#### Angry Villagers

In time the players might become fearless heroes (or feared
anti-heroes). This does not imply that exploitation of the common folk
will be without consequence. Unhappy commoners will first seek the
protection of the church and their local lords. Failing that they will
seek out a hero to fight their cause or, ultimately, rise up as an angry
lynch mob to run despots and villains out of town.

#### Hireling and Retainer Loyalty

Whenever [hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) or
[retainers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) are taken on
the referee should secretly determine their
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) score. A
[hireling](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) or
[retainer’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers)
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) score is
determined with a throw of three six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1), then adjusted
according to an initial
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check (−2 to +2), the character’s
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty)
adjustment due to
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma) (−2 to +4), and
whether or not the
[hireling](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) or
[retainer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) is a
disinherited [relative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#relatives)
(0 to −5). The result is noted by the referee, to be referred to
whenever subsequent
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
or
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks are required.

| \*\* Will never betray or desert.                  |                    |

### The Dice

Delving Deeper referees require polyhedral dice of the four-, six-,
eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided sorts and are assumed to possess
these.

Wherever number ranges appear in the text the referee should throw the
appropriate number of dice to produce a result within the specified
range. For example, a range of 1-6 is generated by throwing a six-sided
die, a range of 2-7 is generated by throwing a six-sided die and adding
1 to the result, a range of 2-10 is generated by throwing a six- and a
four-sided die and summing the results, and so on.

Common number ranges are given in the table below—the referee can
extrapolate other ranges from these examples. A ten-sided die should
ideally be a twenty-sided polyhedron marked 0-9 twice, but alternatively
can be a ten-sided polyhedron marked 0-9 once (although these are not a
platonic solid).

A range of 1-100 can be generated with a throw of two ten-sided dice.
The result of the first die is multiplied by ten before the pair is
summed. Thus, a throw of 4 and 2 makes 42, a throw of 6 and 0 makes 60,
and a throw of 0 and 6 makes 06. A double zero makes 100.

## Creating a Dungeon

Before the players can explore the labyrinthine
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)
the referee must map at least one such
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) on a
sheet of graph paper. A
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
should have many levels and sub-levels that are interconnected by
stairs, trapdoors, chutes, slanting passages, and so on. The referee is
advised to begin by drawing a cross section of the entire structure in
order to understand the means of egress between the various levels.

It is desirable that there be several
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
entrances, that there be a number routes between the various levels, and
that richer areas be harder to find. Deeper
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels will be more rewarding but also more dangerous, so players should
(usually) be allowed to navigate to the desired
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level when such routes are known.

A [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
need not be mapped completely—it may well be vast or even limitless. It
should, however, extend as far as the players are likely to explore in
their initial delve. Thus, the referee is advised to plan much of the
first level and some parts of the second and third levels. Each square
of a [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level plan should represent 10ft in the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) and,
like the [campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign)
map, [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
maps must remain unknown to the players.

Having drawn a cross section and begun mapping of the first few levels,
the referee should give the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) a
name and note at least one entrance to the first
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level on his
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) map.

### Populating a Dungeon

With a dungeon level planned, or substantially so, the referee must
distribute [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps), and
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) throughout the
maze. The principal
[treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) should be
placed thoughtfully, then random determination used to fill the balance
of the level.

The referee should throw two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) for each
unpopulated dungeon location and consult the table of random dungeon
locations.

#### Empty Rooms

Empty rooms occur frequently and will usually be welcomed even if they
are foreboding or completely nondescript. These might be used by the
players to [rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) or
regroup, lay ambushes, establish a defensible position, or whatever else
the referee allows.

#### Monsters

Where Monsters are indicated the referee should consult the random
monster tables for the appropriate
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level. Note that monsters are not all “meant” to be beatable. Some will
be deadly foes and players should learn to flee from these.

##### Distortions

can alter the appearance of
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3),
the sense of depth, [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale),
or direction, or even the flow of time and can frustrate even diligent
mapping. A miniaturized Kingdom could be hidden in a bottle or a room or
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level could accelerate time one-hundred fold.

##### Geases

will compel a victim to perform some
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest), deed, or undesirable
action. Possibilities include abandoning all carried
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) in a nearby
vault, submitting oneself to an evil high priest, converting a dozen
people to the chaotic
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment), or slaying
the [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) on the next
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level.

##### Illusions

can be of anything at all including glamorous
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), impassible
obstacles, irresistible feasts, distraught prisoners, luxurious
appointments over squalor, or solid footing over openings. The purpose
of these is to deter or delay progress, draw the unwary into a
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps), conceal
some route or object, or to raise an alarm if meddled with.

##### Oblique Construction

includes any room or passage are not aligned perfectly north-south or
east-west, but at an oblique angle. The difference should not be
immediately noticed by players so as to prevent them from mapping the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) too
accurately.

##### Pits

are typically 10-40ft deep and either open or covered by trapdoor lids.
When passed over a trapdoor will open if the referee throws a 5-6 on a
six-sided die and some will automatically snap shut. A pit could be
empty or contain a
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). Hitting the
bottom will cause 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per 10ft fallen and
any [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) present
will automatically have the advantage of
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) in the
following [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Deep pits
could be filled with water causing armored characters to
[drown](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#drowning). Shallow pits
could contain [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) or
jagged rocks pointing upward that will cause an additional 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) should anyone
[fall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#falling) upon them.
[Spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) present may or may
not be [poisoned](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison_1).

##### Shifting Walls

might be moved by player action or by automation, intermittently
revealing (or concealing) stairs, passages, or secret vaults or simply
preventing the players from returning the way they came. Fresh
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
sections can be revealed and tried sections hidden. Whole sections can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) in a
clockwork labyrinth.

##### Sinking Rooms

can seal the players in by closing portals or by barring exits with
heavy weights. Some will then fill with water, [green
slime](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#green-slime), or
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). Others will
carry the players to a lower
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level with no possible recourse—or seem to while in fact only turning on
the same level.

##### Sloping Passages

or halls descend gently and will not be noticed by players (other than
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1)). These can see
the players inadvertently exploring the next deeper
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level.

##### Teleportation

will instantly send an individual or a group elsewhere upon touching a
gem, skull, or mirror, or upon passing through a portal. Possible
destinations include an identical room with nothing to indicate that
teleportation has occurred, a
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) lair, a safe
haven, another
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level, a location thousands of miles away, or even another planet or
alternate dimension.

##### Trick Doors

are of many kinds including [secret
doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors), false
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) or portals that lead
only to dead ends, [doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors)
that will open only when a password is spoken or a riddle is solved,
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) that can be opened
from one side but not the other, portals that can only be found
intermittently, or [doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors)
whose destination changes each time they are used. The possibilities are
endless.

##### Trick Stairs

are of various designs including stairs not deep enough to change level,
stairs whose destination changes each time they are used, stairs that
collapse into a steeply inclined slide which is a one-way route to a
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) lair or deeper
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level, stairs that can only be found intermittently, and so on.

#### Treasure Guarded by Monsters

[Monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) guarding
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) are determined
with the random monster tables. If the resulting
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) has a
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) type and
appropriate numbers can be accommodated then the location can be a lair.
Otherwise it is not a lair and the
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) includes
400-2,400 sp per
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level, 50% chance of 200-1,200 gp per
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level, 5% chance per
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level of 1-6 gems + 1 gem per
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level, 5% chance per
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level of 1-6 pieces of jewelry, and 5% chance per two
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels of one item from the Magic Items table.

Where non-player characters are indicated, these are bands of 1-6
player-types of randomly determined
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes);
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter),
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user), or
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) (with
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
optionally appearing). Each non-player character has 1-3 experience
levels plus as many experience levels as the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level they are encountered on. The whole group will be accompanied by
2-12 [mercenaries](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mercenaries) as
well as 1-6 pages, acolytes, or apprentices with up to half as many
experience levels as their least experienced superior.

Fighters have a 10% chance per experience level of possessing a [magic
sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) and are half as
likely to possess a magic
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or magic
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).
[Clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) are 2% likely
per experience level to possess a magic
[mace](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flails-and-maces),
[flail](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flails-and-maces), hammer,
or [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) and are
5% likely to possess a magic
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or magic
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).
[Magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) are 5%
likely per experience level to possess a magic
[wand](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) and are
equally likely to possess a magic
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) or a [miscellaneous
magic
item](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#miscellaneous-magic-items). In
all cases, check separately for each item.

#### Treasure Guarded by Traps

Traps are frequently set to guard
[treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures). Where this
is indicated the
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) can be
designed thoughtfully to fit the environs or determined with the
[tricks](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) and
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) table
(substituting a deadly
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) for any
[sloping passage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sloping-passages)
or [oblique
construction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oblique-construction)).
The [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) is as
described above.

#### Unguarded Treasure

Unguarded [treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) are
as above and should be hidden behind [secret
doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors), under
trapdoors or floors, up chimneys, made to look plain or invisible by
[illusions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions), or locked in
safes or strong boxes. In short, the players should face some challenge
to gain them.

## Underworld Exploration

The referee is advised to
[keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep) careful track of time
and resources as the players explore the underworld. Exploration is
conducted in [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of 10
minute duration with 1" representing 10ft. Thus a [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) of 12" is
reckoned to be 120ft underground with two such
[moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) allowed
per [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of cautious
progress; [listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) for
noises, watching for ambush, making a map, and so on. If all caution is
abandoned (during [flight or
pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit), for
example)
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) is
quadrupled but mapping becomes impossible.

##### Searching

for [traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps),
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), or [secret
doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors) should take a
full [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). The referee must
adjudicate how long other activities will take including hiding, use of
divinations, and circumventing
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps).

##### Light

is essential underground. Torches, lanterns, and magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) can
be used to illuminate the way though the former might be extinguished by
sudden gusts of
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds). Torches and
lanterns will light a 30ft radius and burn for 6 and 24
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), respectively.
[Dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
denizens are assumed to see well in the dark, however, and carrying
light will ruin any possibility of surprising them, except by coming
through a [door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors).

##### Listening

A [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
should be troubled by distant creaks, echoes, and moans, and any player
may wish to listen for these, or at a
[door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) before trying it, as a
precautionary measure. In such cases the referee should throw a
six-sided die for the player with a result of 6 (or a result of 5-6 for
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1),
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1), and
[halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1)) indicating
that the character identifies any audible sound. Bickering
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) will be rackety, for
example, while the undead will be absolutely silent.

##### Doors

in the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) are
typically stuck and must be forced by
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength).
[Men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men),
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1), and
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) can defeat these
with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die, while
[halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1) and other
weaklings would usually require a throw of 6. Bursting through a door in
this manner might
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) whomever is on
the other side, but any failed attempt will automatically ruin this
opportunity and might also attract [wandering
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wandering-monsters) to the
noise. Two characters can simultaneously apply their
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) to a single
door, but they will be unable to
[react](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monster-reaction) to
whatever is lurking on the other side as they burst through.

Dungeon denizens have the knack of opening each
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) door
and can pass through easily unless a door has been held shut by the
characters. Despite the difficulty in opening them, doors will
automatically close. Even if a door is wedged open by the characters it
will later be found to have been closed if the referee throws a 5-6 on a
six-sided die.

##### Secret doors

and passages will be discovered by any player actively
[searching](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#searching) if the
referee throws a 5-6 (or 3-6 for
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) and also
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
if these are used) on a six-sided die. Locating a secret
[door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) will reveal the
mechanism for opening it, but not activate it. The secret
[door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) must be intentionally
opened by the character.

##### Rest

One [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) is required after a
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) or any hour of
exploration and two [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
of [rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) are required
after [flight or
pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit).

##### Traps

are sprung if the referee throws a 5-6 on a six-sided die as a character
passes over or nearby. Many of these are deadly.
[Traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) can be
located before they are sprung, however, in much the same manner as can
[secret doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#secret-doors). A
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) can usually
be circumvented or avoided once it has been found.

### Underworld Encounters

Each [dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level can contain thoughtfully prepared
[encounters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
as well as [wandering
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wandering-monsters). The
former are [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
lairs, hideouts, treasuries, meeting places, and so on devised during
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
design. The referee should also check for [wandering
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wandering-monsters) at the
end of each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
exploration. This is done by throwing a six-sided die with a 6
indicating the appearance of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

The kind of [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
should be determined randomly. This is accomplished by dicing for the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
table to use and then dicing on that table to determine which kind of
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) appears.

#### Wandering Monsters

The number of wandering
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) appearing
should be as per the “No. Encountered” for their type. Having determined
their numbers the referee should then throw to determine whether there
is a lair of such
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) nearby. If
so, then any member of the wandering group slain or captured is deducted
from those found later in the lair.

More fearsome [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
will often be fewer in number, but even the lowliest sorts can be deadly
in their multitudes. The referee can exercise his discretion if an
undesired
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is indicated, remembering that deeper
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels are intended to be more dangerous than shallower
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
levels.

#### Surprise

When [wandering
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wandering-monsters) occur
the referee should first determine whether either party is surprised.
[Surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) is possible
only when either or both parties are unaware of the other.
[Light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2), noise,
[listening](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#listening) at or forcing
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors), and various
divinations can negate the possibility of
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise); otherwise,
either party will
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) the other with
a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die.
[Thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used) instead
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) with a throw of
3-6.

#### Encounter Distance

If either party is surprised the
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 10-60ft distance and the surprised party will be unable to
respond for one [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns);
otherwise, the
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 20-120ft distance.
[Melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) range is 1" (10ft
in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)).

#### Monster Behavior

With or without [surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise)
the direction and manner of a
[monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) approach
should be adjudicated by the referee in accordance with its type, the
surroundings, and the disposition of the players. Unintelligent
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will simply
attack, while those with any cunning will judge the situation
accordingly. Chaotics are predisposed to attack lawfuls, and vice versa,
and [normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) will only
attack 4th (or higher) level
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) if there are
no other targets.

The referee can otherwise determine
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) behavior
according to the following table, adjusting any result for bribes
offered, perceived threats, differences of race or
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment), and so on.

| 9-11                     | Positive     |
| 12 or more               | Enthusiastic |

#### Avoiding Monsters

The players have the option to flee unchallenged whenever
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) are surprised
or are more than 3" (30ft in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration))
distant. [Monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will
[pursue](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) unless
they are surprised or have a proper motivation not to.

Flight and
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit)
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed) is four times normal
pace with no mapping possible. The gap will open or close according to
the [movement
rates](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) of the two
parties, and
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) will
continue for so long as the pursuers do not fall more than a full
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) behind
(more than 90ft behind for pursuers with a [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) of 9"). The
players may wish to discard
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) or
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment) in order to
lighten their encumbrance and increase their
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed). Should the players
turn a corner, take a stair, or pass through a
[door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) the pursuers will
continue only if a throw of a six-sided die is 5-6.

Discarded foodstuffs will distract unintelligent pursuers with a throw
of 2-6 on a six-sided die, and animal or intelligent pursuers with a
throw of 4-6 or 6, respectively.
[Treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) is inversely
likely to distract pursuers and burning oil is also an effective
deterrent.

### Maintaining Freshness

As the players explore a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level its [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
stocks and [treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)
will begin to be diminished and so too will its mystery. While egress to
the greater challenges of lower levels is desirable, the referee should
never allow any
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
level to become too well known.

If even a single chamber is left unguarded for any length of time there
is the possibility of new denizens arriving to replace losses. These
might be from adjacent areas, lower levels, or newly excavated passages.
[Monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) that
previously eluded the players might fortify areas by blocking or
collapsing passages, barring
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors), setting new
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps), and so
on. Intelligent
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) might set
alarms or leave warnings in case of the players’ return.

The referee should not shy from extending the limits of a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) so
that fresh areas always await exploration. Should the players
nonetheless become blasé, the referee can introduce wholesale change due
to cave-in, subsidence, flooding, supernatural winter, reality
[distortion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#distortions), slime
plague, and so on. These are but a few of the options the referee can
employ to [keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep) a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
fresh and challenging.

## Combat

These mechanics are intentionally abstract so that combat is fast and
furious.

##### Scale

For the purpose of
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) 1" represents 10ft
and each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) is one minute
in duration. A lot can happen in one minute of
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) and any
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) can be decisive.

##### Surprise

allows one [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
unanswered actions. If these should include attacks they will be at +2
to hit and, if struck, the target will drop anything held with a throw
of 1-2 on a six-sided die.

##### Intent

Each player declares his intent for the upcoming
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), stating whether his
character will attack, utter a spell, overturn a boiling
[cauldron](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cauldron), or whatever.

##### Initiative

The referee resolves all actions for the
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in whatever order he
judges fair.

He may grant initiative to those firing
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) into
advancing enemies, or to those with the advantage of reach (in the first
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) or lighter weapons
(in subsequent [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)), or
to those fighting on battlements above. Otherwise, initiative is
determined by throwing a six-sided die per group, or per combatant
(adjusting for
[dexterity](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dexterity)), with the
higher score gaining the first opportunity to attack that
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

Magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) can
be [cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
successfully in the [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
that [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) is joined if
the caster wins initiative; otherwise, the caster is interrupted and his
spell is ruined before completion. While a spell caster remains engaged
in [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
is not possible.

### Melee

Any character within 1" is eligible to attack or be attacked in melee
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).

Performance throughout a
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) is determined with
a single attack roll—a throw of one twenty-sided die. However, against
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types),
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) and
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) instead
throw one attack roll for each of their own [hit
die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice).

When a single attack roll is used the attacker strikes according to his
level (for characters) or number of [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) (for
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)). When
multiple attack rolls are used the attacker always strikes as a 1 [hit
die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice)
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2), regardless of
how many levels or [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) he
actually has.

Table 2.8 Attack Matrix

In either case attack rolls are adjusted for tactical factors, magic
weaponry, and enchantments and the result compared to the target’s
[armor class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee) on the attack
matrix. A total equal to or greater than the number required indicates
an effective [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of action
(a “hit”). Anything less indicates an ineffective
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of action (a “miss”).

#### Space Required

Note that [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) requires
space. The referee should allow perhaps three
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) to stand abreast in a
10ft wide passage if they carry
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears); swords and
[axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes) would require more
space. Up to six [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can
surround a single [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized
target (with rear attacks striking at +2 to hit), while up to eight
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can surround a larger
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

#### Parrying

A defender can forgo his attack to parry and cause an opponent to suffer
a −4 attack penalty. Should his opponent miss because of this −4 penalty
the defender’s weapon will be dashed from his grasp by a heavier weapon.
If, on the other hand, his opponent misses regardless of this penalty
the defender is allowed a counter-attack if equipped with a lighter
weapon.

#### Damage

If a single attack roll is used a hit will cause 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
damage and be adjusted for
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength), magical
weaponry, and other factors.
[Spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) set to receive a
charge and charging lancers will instead cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
damage and large
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) can cause
more damage. If multiple attack rolls are used versus
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types), each
hit causes exactly 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
damage; all other adjustments are already represented by the multiple
attack rolls.

Should any character be reduced to zero (or fewer) [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice), he
is slain. Whether or not sustaining damage will otherwise affect a
character is left to the referee’s discretion. Any unresolved attacks of
a slain character are wasted.

#### Attacking to Subdue

Most intelligent
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (including
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)) can be
subdued and made to surrender if this
[intent](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intent) is announced prior
to attacks being resolved.
[Damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) from subdual hits
is recorded independently of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) from actual hits.
After any [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in which
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) is suffered the
referee must determine the sum of subdual
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) sustained as a
percentage of actual [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
Confidence is then checked by throwing a hundred-sided die with any
result lower than the percentage of subdual
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) sustained
indicating the [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
is subdued.

Subdued [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will
initially obey without
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks and can be sold as slaves, pets, or curiosities or brought into
service as [retainers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) if
an acceptable offer is made.

### Overbearing

Man-types can grapple an enemy bare-handed in order to overpower and
capture him without killing him.

If the defender is armed, or is not a
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types), each attacker
must make a successful attack roll before being able to contribute to
the overbearing attempt. Each contributing attacker throws a six-sided
die for each of his own [hit
die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice) (although no more
than six [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can attempt to
overbear a single [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) at a
time).

The defender then throws one six-sided die for each of his [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) and
the totals are compared. If the attackers’ total is higher the defender
will be hopelessly pinned. If the scores are equal the struggle is
unresolved and can continue next
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). If the defender’s
total is higher the attackers are thrown back 1" and unable to
participate in the struggle next
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

### Missile Fire

Missile fire is as [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) except that attack
rolls represent shooting at range and are adjusted for
[dexterity](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dexterity). Short range
fire (including most
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) shot
underground) is at +2 to hit. Hand-hurled
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) are
reckoned to always be at medium range and are thus at +1 to hit. Long
range [missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire
is usually possible only outdoors and is at normal hit probability.
[Bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) can throw two attack
rolls per [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) if
stationary. All
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire on the
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) (other
than [elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) firing
[bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows)) is at −2 to hit.
Firing from or into [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
is not normally allowed.

Fireballs, [lightning
bolts](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lightning-bolt), and like
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) must occupy
their full area of effect. Hurling these into confined
[spaces](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required) will cause
them to rebound off walls to fill the necessary
[space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required), including
back towards the caster.

### Morale

A
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check can be used to determine how
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (including
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)) will
[react](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monster-reaction) in
potentially life-threatening circumstances.

The referee alone adjudicates when
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
should be checked but will normally do so whenever potentially deadly
circumstances occur. Thus,
[hireling](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) or
[retainer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers)
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
would be checked when a deadly
[trap](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) is sprung,
when attacked by
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise), when losing a
battle (at one-third losses), when a leader is slain, captured, or
routed.

Particularly fearsome foes including the greater
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) and
[rocs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rocs),
[wraiths](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wraiths), and 8th (or
higher) level
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) will cause
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
(including player characters) to check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
merely by attacking.

#### Morale Checks

The players have their own
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
so their characters are not subject to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks unless compelled by magic or other
[super-normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) threat.
It may, however, be necessary to check the
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
of [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (including
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)) either
fighting the players or serving them. Unintelligent
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) need never
check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).

A
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check is made by throwing two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) for the affected
party. The total is adjusted for
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty),
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) type, and
other circumstances as appropriate.

#### Adjustments to Morale Check

Monsters are assumed to have
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
adjustments as stated in the [explanation of
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-monsters);
however, the referee may wish to ascribe a
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) score to
particular individuals. This can be done in the same manner as for
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) or
[retainers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers) serving the
players (by summing three six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)) or by edict.
High or low
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty) would
adjust a [monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks accordingly, overruling the generic
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
adjustments given in the [explanation of
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-monsters).

The referee can also adjust
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks for specific circumstances including:

-   Those fighting alongside a 4th (or higher) level
    [fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) adjust
    their
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    by +1,
-   Evil sorts fighting alongside a
    [wraith](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wraiths) adjust their
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    by +1,
-   A [bless](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bless) spell adjusts
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    checks of those affected by +1,
-   [Orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs),
    [goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins), and
    [hobgoblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hobgoblins) suffer
    a −1
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    penalty in daylight,
-   [Ghouls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ghouls),
    [wights](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wights), and
    [wraiths](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wraiths) suffer a −2
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    penalty in daylight,
-   [Kobolds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#kobolds) suffer a −1
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    penalty unless they are defending their lair and outnumber their
    enemies by at least 3 to 1,
-   [Mermen](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mermen) suffer a −2
    [morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
    penalty on land.

See the [explanation of
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-monsters)
for further cases.

#### Morale Check Outcome

The referee can determine
[monsters’](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) (or
[retainers’](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainers)) behavior
for the next [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) by
throwing a
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check and consulting the
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check table.

The referee should interpret the outcome by considering the capabilities
and disposition of the affected party; non-combatants would not attack,
troops defending a fortification would not abandon their advantage, and
so on.

### Healing

Lost [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) can
be recovered by magical means and by ordinary
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting), albeit at a much
slower rate. One [hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) is
regained for every two days of complete
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) in which no other
productive activity can be undertaken.

### Mounted Combat

#### Jousting!

Jousts are knightly contests of
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). A
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) must possess
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields),
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields),
[helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms), mount, and at
least one lance to participate.

A joust is scored as the best of three tilts in which two
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat) knights
enter the lists and, separated by a barrier, make an unimpeded charge at
one another with the objective of unhorsing the opponent. Each throws a
single, simultaneous attack roll adjusted for the quality of his mount:
[destrier](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) +8, [war
horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) +6, riding or [draft
horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) +2. On a hit throw
two six-sided [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and
consult the jousting table. For sport the lesser of the two
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) indicates
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) sustained; in war
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) is the sum of both

A glancing blow scores no points. Breaking a lance upon the opponent
scores one point, or three points upon the opponent’s
[helmet](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms). Unhorsing
the opponent scores ten points. If a knight cannot continue due to
injury he loses. The loser forfeits his mount or a grander wager by
prior arrangement.

#### Mounted Men Attacking

Charging lancers attack at +4 and cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and use the
jousting table to determine broken lances and unhorsing. Otherwise,
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) attack those
on foot at +2.
[Mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat) [war
horses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) and [giant
wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves-giant) can also
attack enemies on foot, having one attack roll per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) even versus
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types).

#### Attacking Mounted Men

Man-sized characters on foot attack
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) at −2.

#### Shooting at Mounted Men

Missile fire against
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) is
likewise penalized by −2. A
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[heroic-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) is
subject to [missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire)
fire only on a six-sided die throw of 5-6; otherwise his mount is
subject to that
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire.

Any hit on a rider will unhorse him on a six-sided die throw of 6. He
will crash to the ground and be stunned for the remainder of the
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) and, if he throws 1-4
on a six-sided die, for all of the following
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in addition. Should a
rider or his mount be slain he is likewise unhorsed.

### Saving Throws

Saving throws are used when deadly threats occur. They represent one
last chance to avert disaster. Players throw for their characters and
the referee throws for the
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). If either
throws equal to or greater than the indicated number in the required
category the direst consequences are avoided. Anything less invites
disaster.

##### Poison

includes diseases and all deadly biological attacks such as
[snake](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#snakes-giant-and-large)
bites, [scorpion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scorpions-giant),
[spider](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spiders-giant-and-large) or
[wyvern](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wyverns) stings, imbibing
poisoned wine, and wounds from envenomed weapons. This category is also
used against the
[cloudkill](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cloudkill) and [slaying
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slaying-spell).

##### Wands and Rays

includes rays, beams, and other attacks which can be dodged or deflected
including [wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands)
of paralysis and lightning. This category is also used against the
[disintegrate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#disintegrate), finger
of death, and [lightning
bolt](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lightning-bolt)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

##### Paralysis and Petrification

includes gross physiological attacks such as paralysis by contact with a
[gelatinous cube](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-gelatinous-cube)
or petrification by
[medusa](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#medusae),
[basilisk](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#basilisks),
[cockatrice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#cockatrices), or
[gorgon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gorgons) attack. This
category is also used against the flesh to stone,
[haste](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#haste), [hold
monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hold-monster), [hold
person](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hold-person),
[polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#polymorph), and
[slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

##### Breath Weapon

includes any cloud or area attacks such as
[chimera](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#chimeras) and
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) breath weapons,
the [wand of ice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wand-of-ice), and
splash attacks including acid, burning oil, or
[Holy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#holy) water. This category is
also used against the
[fireball](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fireball) and
[web](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#web)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

##### Spells

are coercive, mind-affecting sorts of magic including
[dryad](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dryads) and
[nixie](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#nixies) charms,
[vampire](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vampires) gaze attacks,
delirium caused by speaking with godlike beings, and domination by
[magic swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords). This
category is also used against the [charm
person](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charm-person), [color
spray](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#color-spray),
[confusion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#confusion),
[fear](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fear),
[feeblemind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#feeblemind), [magic
jar](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-jar), and
[phantasm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#phantasm)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

#### Saving Throws for Magical Items

With the exception of
[helms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) (which can be
destroyed in [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)),
magic items are assumed to remain intact so long as the player survives.
However, the referee may wish to allow items to be destroyed when the
character is slain or otherwise exposed to particularly adverse
circumstances. In this case the referee should make a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) for each item
concerned.

| Weapon                        | 10       |

Arms, [armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields),
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), and
[rings of protection](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#protection)
add their defensive adjustment to their [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws). Items that
produce spell-like effects adjust their [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) by +2 against
similar effects. Thus, a [wand of
fireball](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wand-of-fireball) and a
[flametongue](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flametongue) sword
would save at +2 versus [red
dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-red) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon).

The referee should be circumspect about item [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws). Effects such
as [poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#neutralize-poison),
[confusion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#confusion), and
[feeblemind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#feeblemind) would not
affect most magic items but petrification and disintegration would.

## Wilderness Exploration

The referee will already have a map of the players’ starting location
and the surrounding countryside. This will be critical for further
exploration and for the establishment of
[strongholds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds), trade,
and alliances later in the game. Whether regions unknown to the players
are drawn in advance or as they are explored is up the referee. In
either case the principal features should be placed thoughtfully with
the remainder being filled in by random determination.

Table 2.13 Random Wilderness Features

Note that rivers and trails should span a number of hexagons. Except in
mountains (where rivers begin), swamps (where rivers end), and open
hexes (where trails end), the referee should place these features
without dicing when all other adjoining hexes have been resolved without
these occurring.

### Time and Movement

For the purpose of
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration 1" represents 1 mile and each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) is a day in duration.
The standard [movement
rates](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) in inches
are therefore the number of miles covered per day. Each hexagon is
assumed to be 6 miles across, so the standard [movement
rates](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) can be
translated easily into a number of hexagons covered per day.

Difficult terrain including woods, swamps, and desert slow ground
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) by
half except along a trail. Rivers are impassable other than at
[fords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fords) and bridges, as are
mountains other than by trails that can be navigated only on foot at
half rate.

#### Visibility

Visibility is generally limited to one hex (6 miles) range from a good
vantage in open terrain. However, the referee may wish to allow
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility) of up to
three hexes (18 miles) when surveying open terrain from mountain passes,
or up to 11-16 hexes (up to 100 miles) from a lofty mountain summit in
clear [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather). Note that
intervening terrain and
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions can
severely restrict
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility).

#### Resting

All travelers require a full day of
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) after six days on
the [move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2).
[Dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) instead require a
full week of sleep after six weeks of activity.

### Weather

Weather conditions should be determined each day in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
If the previous day was hot throw one six-sided die and add 1. If it
rained the previous day throw one six-sided die and add 6. Otherwise,
throw two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) to determine
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions each
day.

Hot [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) will cause
thirst, increase fatigue, and halve [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1). Hot
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) will also
increase the risk of fire in the dry season.

Rain of any sort will reduce
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility). Hard rain
will halve [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1), as will any
rain in the wet season.

### Becoming Lost

So long as players stick to established routes they will have little
difficulty navigating from one
[settlement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#settlements-and-strongholds_1)
to another. However, once they strike out into the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration),
there is the possibility of becoming
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). The referee
should secretly throw a six-sided die for the players each day with a 1
(in open terrain), a 1-2 (in woods or mountains), or a 1-3 (in swamp or
desert) indicating that the players have gotten
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). If the
players are [lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost)
they will
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) in an
undesired direction that day without realizing it.

### Strongholds

Where a stronghold is indicated it is an occupied
[keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep), tower, or fastness at
a strategic locale such as a bluff, crossroad, valley, bridge, or
island. The principal resident of the stronghold should be determined
randomly, as follows:

The resident will be of 9th to 12th experience level and will be
attended by an entourage as indicated above. These are as for a lair of
the appropriate type or else 1-6 individuals where no lair type is
given. Heroes and anti-heroes indicate bands of 3-18
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) of 3rd to
6th experience level (determined individually).

The resident may also have one or several lieutenants of level 5-8. A
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) is 50% likely
to be attended by a
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) or a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user). A
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) is 50%
likely to be attended by a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) or 1-6
apprentices
([magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) of
level 3-6). A [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
is 50% likely to be attended by a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) or 1-6
assistants ([clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) of
level 3-6). Check separately for either in all cases.

Regardless of the above a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) is
occupied by a force of 30-180 soldiers with a similar number of
supporting
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands). If the
principal resident is chaotic these are 50% likely to be
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs); otherwise, they are
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).

Should the characters pass near a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds), the
resident’s scouts or [spies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spies)
will spot them with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die at two hexes
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3),
with a throw of 5-6 at one hex
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3),
and with a throw of 3-6 if they pass within the same hex as the
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) itself. If
they are spotted, or if they hail the
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) directly,
the resident will respond to their presence.

A chaotic strongholder will always attempt to slay, capture, enslave, or
deceive the players to gain whatever
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) or knowledge
they might have or hold out against them if they are overly powerful.

A resident [fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)
will challenge the highest level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) to a
[joust](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#jousting). Should the player
[joust](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#jousting) and win he earns
the right to the challenger’s hospitality for up to a full month for
himself and his company—although a chaotic or neutral challenger may
prove reluctant to pay!

Should the player [joust](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#jousting)
and lose the challenger will demand his mount. If the players lack a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) or decline
the contest, the challenger will levy a toll of 1,000-4,000 gp for their
passage.

A [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) will
exact a toll of one magic item of his choice from the player characters
or else 1,000-6,000 gp if they have nothing desirable. If they cannot
pay the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
may [geas](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#geases) them to collect
the necessary [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)
on some [quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest). The
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) will
take his pick of any
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) recovered, or
perhaps all of it.

A lawful [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) will
require a tribute for his temple amounting to one-tenth part of whatever
wealth the player characters have. If they cannot pay the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) may
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) them to perform some
lawful mission—which will earn them his hospitality if completed
successfully. An
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) may
demand one-fourth part of whatever wealth the player characters have. If
they cannot pay he might simply slay them or else
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) them to perform some
chaotic mission—which might be their undoing.

### Fords

Rivers and waterways are generally impassable other than at fords and
bridges (except with a [control
water](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#control-water) spell). These
will frequently be occupied and, should an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
occur in the vicinity of a ford or bridge, the referee may assume the
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is at that feature.

### Settlements

Villages and towns have 100-400 and 1,000-6,000 inhabitants,
respectively. Areas surrounding friendly towns are usually relatively
safe. Farther from civilization roads are unkempt and there are few
patrols. Folk in these parts are unfriendly, if not dangerous, and any
kind of [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) might
be encountered.

The referee can assume that the 3 hexes (18 mile radius) around a
friendly [stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds)
is cleared, patrolled, or otherwise relatively safe. Towns and villages
control smaller areas, but all that lies beyond this immediate vicinity
is known as
“[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)”.
These vast tracts are nonetheless dotted with villages and castles of
unknown disposition, as well as enclaves, ruins, and other curiosities
awaiting discovery.

### Wilderness Encounters

Wandering [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
occur in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
as they do in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration).
The referee should check once per day in the immediate vicinity of a
friendly
[settlement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#settlements-and-strongholds_1)
or [stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) with a
throw of 6 on a six-sided die indicating an encounter. In the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
proper he should check once per day in open terrain or desert or twice
per day in woods, swamps, mountains, and riverlands. The referee should
make one additional check per day if the players are
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost) or are at a
bridge or [ford](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fords).

When an encounter is indicated the referee can determine the type of
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) by dicing on
the appropriate
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
encounter table for the terrain type.

#### Surprise

Surprise occurs in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
(as it does in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration))
with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die except that animals will not be
surprised from upwind. If the players are surprised they will typically
find themselves encircled.

#### Encounter Distance

If either party is surprised an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be
unable to respond for one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns); otherwise, an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 20-120 yards distance.
[Melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) range is 1" (10
yards) in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).

#### Monster Reaction

Monster
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
to the players in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
is as per the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration).

### Evasion and Pursuit

A smaller group may desire to
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) a
larger group rather than
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
them. Hostile [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
(including previously offended
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) residents)
will [pursue](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit)
with a throw of 4-6 on a six-sided die, while non-hostiles will
[pursue](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) only
with a throw of 6.

The possibility of evading an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is determined by the
[relative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#relatives) size of the
parties. If the evaders are not more than one-quarter as numerous as the
pursuers they will
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) with a
throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. If they are no more than half as
numerous as the pursuers they will
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) with a
throw of 4-6; otherwise they will
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) only
with a throw of 5-6.

The odds of
[evasion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) are
adjusted as follows:

#### Surprise

If the pursuers are surprised
[evasion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) is 1
chance in 6 more likely. If the evaders are surprised there is no
opportunity to
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) unless
low [visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility) or good
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed) dicates otherwise.

#### Low visibility

Woods, misty swamps, night, rain, fog, or snow all increase the chance
of [evasion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) by
1 in 6, even if surprised.

#### Speed

If either side’s [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) is at least
twice the other side’s [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) the odds of
[evasion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) (or
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit)) are
tipped in their favor by 1 chance in 6, even if surprised.

To resolve a
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit)
scenario the evaders should throw one die. If the result is too low to
[evade](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit), the
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit)
catches up and an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is unavoidable; otherwise, the evaders have managed to gain ground over
the [pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit).

Assuming the evaders have gained ground, the referee should determine
whether or not the pursuers will continue to give chase. Unless specific
circumstances dictate otherwise, the chase will continue with a throw of
4-6 on a six-sided die. If the pursuers throw high enough they gain
ground and the
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) is
still on; otherwise, they have fallen too far behind and the
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) is
over.

This is repeated until either the pursuers give up or an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
occurs.

Note that mapping is impossible during a
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit). The
referee should position the evaders somewhere within 1-6 hexes of their
starting location at the conclusion of a chase.

Both parties must [rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting)
for the remainder of the
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) (the day) after
resolving a
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit),
regardless of whether it resulted in an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
or not. At the beginning of the next
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) (day) the players are
considered to be
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). They will not
know exactly where they are, only that they have endured a long
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) and
covered many leagues in a general direction.

## Seafaring Exploration

As with
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration, ocean regions unknown to the players can be mapped in
advance or as they are explored. The principal features should be placed
thoughtfully with the remainder being filled in by random determination.

The referee can use the random
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
tables to generate ocean regions for seafaring. Hexes of open terrain
should be read as open ocean, woods as coast, mountains as reefs, desert
as islands, and swamp as perpetually stormy ocean. Likewise, rivers
should be read as strong currents,
[fords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fords) as confluences of
currents, and trails as navigable seafaring routes. The other features
are as in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
except that villages should be ignored.

### Time and Movement

Seafaring exploration retains the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration timescale of 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) per day.

Coastal waters (up to 3 hexes from land) and navigable inland rivers
retain the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) where
each 1" of [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) represents 1
mile traveled per day. The open ocean, however, is so vast and generally
free of obstruction that sailing rate is improved threefold such that 1"
of [movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
represents 1 league (3 miles) traveled per day.

Exploration by sea is otherwise similar to
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration excepting that players must have an ocean going
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels). These are
of two types: [oared](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels)
and sailed.

##### Oared vessels

such as galleys and longships are not restricted by
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) direction but
galleys, rafts, and boats are unable to withstand the high seas of the
open ocean. These are limited to coastal waters except in calm
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather).

##### Sailed vessels

such as merchants and warships can run swiftly before the
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds), but otherwise
must progress by a series of turns and tacks at impaired
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed). Travel directly into
the [wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) is
generally impossible.

Movement rates for
[oared](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) ships assume
a full and well trained crew. Poor or incomplete crews can achieve half
the listed rate.

Movement rates for sailing ships assume running fore a fresh
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds). All other
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) is
at half rate. Note that sailing rates are faster on the open ocean due
to the possibility of sailing unimpeded day and night.

One hexagon should be added when traveling with a current or subtracted
when traveling against a current.

#### Reserves

With the exception of boats and rafts, all sailing ships carry reserve
oars and all [oared](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels)
ships carry reserve
[sails](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sailed-vessels) to be used
if necessary. These allow
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at
half rate.

#### Resting

All crews require a full day of
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) after six days at
sea or immediately after weathering a
[storm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1).

#### Visibility

Distance to the horizon is determined by height above sea level. From a
ship’s deck [visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility)
is limited to one hex (6 miles). From a crow’s nest a
[sailor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sailors) can see a ship up
to two hexes (12 miles) away in clear
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather). However,
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions can
severely restrict
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility).

### Weather

The [wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds)
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) and direction
should be determined each day at sea. Throw one six-sided die to
determine which hex face the
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) is blowing from
and two six-sided [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
to determine [wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds)
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength).

#### Strong Winds

Boats, rafts, and galleys will capsize in strong
[winds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) on the open
ocean on a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

#### Storms

Navigation is impossible in storm conditions and any
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) will capsize
on a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Any
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) that does
not capsize is instead moved 2-7 hexes in a direction secretly
determined by the referee and is immediately considered to be
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost).

### Becoming Lost

A ship’s [captain](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-ships-captain)
will have no difficulty navigating a known route so long as the
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) remains fair.
However, should the
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) turn nasty, there
is the possibility of becoming
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). The referee
should secretly throw a six-sided die for the players each day spent in
strong [winds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds)—a 1-2
indicating they have gotten
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). If the
players are [lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost)
the referee should
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) them an
unplanned
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3)/direction
on his map that [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
without alerting them.

### Settlements and Strongholds

Settlements and
[strongholds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) occur at
sea as they do in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
These can be wholly or partially submerged, built upon floating
pontoons, clinging to rocky prominences, or whatever else the referee
desires. Whether these are friendly or unfriendly can be determined with
a
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check.

### Encounters at Sea

Wandering [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
occur at sea much as they do in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
The referee need not check for [wandering
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wandering-monsters) while
the players are within 3 hexes (18 miles) of a friendly port, but once
out to sea proper he should check once each day on the open ocean or
twice each day along a coast or waterway. An additional check should be
made each day if the players are
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). A throw of 6
on a six-sided die indicates an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will occur.

When an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is indicated, determine the type of
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) by dicing on
the appropriate
[seafaring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#seafaring-exploration)
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
table. If the players are traveling along a coast or inland waterway an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is equally likely to occur ashore as at sea. In this case, use the
appropriate
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
table.

#### Surprise

Surprise occurs at sea (as it does in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration))
with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. If the players are surprised the
enemy ships or
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will come at
them from upwind, emerge suddenly out of fog banks or rain squalls,
appear from behind rolling waves, or surface unexpectedly from
underwater.

#### Encounter Distance

If either party is surprised an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be
unable to respond for one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns); otherwise, an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 40-240 yards distance.
[Melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) range is 1" (10
yards as in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)).
Shipboard artillery range is typically 300 yards.

#### Monster Reaction

Monster
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
to the players at sea is as per the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration).

### Evasion and Pursuit

Evasion and
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) at
sea is as per the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
with the following additional considerations:

-   Low [visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility)
    occurs in [storms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1),
    rain, fog, and at night,
-   Evaders who are able to submerge will automatically escape pursuers
    without this ability unless they are surprised.

### Seafaring Combat

Vessels can engage in ship-to-ship (or ship-to-[sea
monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sea-monsters))
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). Ships are treated
much as
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)—having hull
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) instead of [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice), and
hull points instead of [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

When ship-to-ship (or ship-to-[sea
monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sea-monsters))
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) occurs the referee
should use the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) (1" to 10 yards and
one minute [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) to
resolve maneuvering and
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire as the
combatants approach one another.

Wind direction, tactical positions, and
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) facings can
be marked on a [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) map if
desired or simply noted as closing
[distances](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3).
[Oared](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) ships can
produce a burst of [speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed)
during [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), adding 6"
to [movement rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1)
for up to three [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) after
which the crew is exhausted.

#### Missile Fire

Ship-board artillery may be fired every other
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) while
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) may be
loosed each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). [Normal
missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-missiles) are
ineffective against ship hulls but are allowed their maximum outdoor
range, giving due consideration to
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions and
ocean swell.

Small galleys are assumed to carry a single artillery battery on the
fore deck. Large galleys carry two batteries (one fore and one aft), and
warships carry four batteries (one each fore, aft, port, and starboard).
Artillery hits cause 2-12 hull points of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and will hole a
ship below the waterline on any score of 10 or more hull points. A holed
ship will sink in 3-18
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) (minutes) unless
repairs are made.

#### Ramming

Medieval ships are not generally built for ramming but a faster ship may
ram a slower ship in the side, circumstances permitting. The ramming
ship sustains one hull die
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) while the rammed
ship sustains half the rammer’s hull
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) (rounded down) in
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). If 10 or more hull
points are sustained the ship is holed below the waterline and will sink
in 3-18 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Meanwhile,
boarding may ensue.

#### Melee

When ships [ram](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ramming), grapple,
or come along side for boarding the referee is advised to use the
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) (1" to 10ft and one
minute [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) to resolve
any hand-to-hand [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).
Ship deck plans can be used much as
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) maps
for this purpose. Troops fleeing from
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) will only pitch
themselves overboard in fair
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) near to land;
otherwise they will surrender.

### Swimming

Any player character who grew up on the coast or by a watercourse can
swim, as can any non-player character who throws a 4-6 on a six-sided
die. Swimming is at a rate of 6" in ideal circumstances; otherwise 3". A
character can swim for at most a single day after which he will
[drown](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#drowning).

### Drowning

Anyone pitched into the sea risks drowning. Half of any ship’s crew
cannot [swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming) and will
automatically drown; otherwise, unarmored
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) who can
[swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming) will survive with a
throw of 2-6 on a six-sided die if they immediately rid themselves of
anything heavier than a
[dagger](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers). Each heavier item
retained increases the risk of drowning by 1 in 6. Leather and mail
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) count for
one and four items, respectively, and plate
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) causes
automatic drowning. During a
[storm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1) there is always a
minimum of 3 chances in 6 of drowning. Survival indicates that the
character has managed to remove his
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) before
drowning.

## Aerial Exploration

Should the players acquire winged mounts they can map
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
and ocean regions by aerial exploration.

The referee may also wish to include cloud top regions which can only be
reached on the wing. The referee can use the random
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
tables to generate cloud top regions for aerial exploration. Hexes of
open terrain should be read as vacant air, woods as islands of solid
cloud, mountains as cloud piercing or floating peaks, desert as
dangerously insubstantial islands of cloud, and swamp as perpetually
stormy regions. Likewise, rivers should represent persistent currents,
[fords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fords) should represent
confluences of currents, and trails should represent navigable tunnels
or air ways. The other features are as per the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
except that villages should be ignored.

### Time and Movement

Aerial exploration retains the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
exploration timescale of 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) per day.

There are two modes of travel on the wing: low and high altitude.

At low altitude it is possible to observe or remain in contact with
ground-level activity including
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) and
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). However, at low
altitude fliers must allow for hazards and turbulence and must weave
routes around, between, or over terrain features.

At high altitude progress is unimpeded other than by the need to roost
overnight; [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) is generally
double that achieved at low altitude.

#### Visibility

Distance to the horizon is
[relative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#relatives) to altitude.
In clear [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather)
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility) is 2-6
hexagons (up to 36 miles) from low altitude, or 11-16 hexes (up to 100
miles) from a lofty mountain summit. However, poor
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions and
intervening mountains will severely restrict
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility). From a
high altitude
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility) is 11-16
hexes (up to 100 miles) in perfect
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather), but is usually
limited by cloud cover.

#### Resting

Flying creatures other than [air
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-air) need to
roost overnight (or during the day if they travel at night).
Additionally, flying creatures other than
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) and [air
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-air) require
a full day of [rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) after
six days on the
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2). [Air
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-air) are
tireless fliers, while
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) require a full
week of sleep after six weeks of activity.

### Weather

Although travel by air is quick it is severely affected by poor
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather).

Weather conditions should be determined by the referee for each day of
[aerial](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#aerial-exploration)
exploration. Throw one six-sided die to determine which hex face the
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) is blowing from
and two [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) to
determine [wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds)
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength).
[Aerial](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#aerial-exploration) travel
can be dangerous in strong
[winds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) and
[storms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1); travelers risk
being dashed into obstacles, struck by lightning or flying debris, and
so on.

##### Strong Winds

Normal-type flying creatures, [flying
carpets](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flying-carpet), [flying
broomsticks](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flying-broomstick), and
the like will crash in strong
[winds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) with a throw
of 1-2 on a six-sided die, checked once each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Storms

Navigation is impossible in storm conditions and any flying creatures
(other than [air
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-air)) or
[vessels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) will crash
with a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die. A flier that does not crash is
instead moved 2-7 hexes in a direction secretly determined by the
referee and is immediately considered to be
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost).

### Becoming Lost

A flier will have no difficulty navigating a known route so long as the
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) remains fair.
However, should the
[weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) turn nasty, it is
possible to become
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). The referee
should secretly throw a six-sided die for the players each day spent in
strong [winds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds)—a 1-2
indicating that they have gotten
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost). If the
players are [lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost)
the referee should
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) them an
unplanned
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3)/direction
on his map that [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
without alerting them.

### Settlements and Strongholds

Settlements and
[strongholds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) occur in
the air as they do in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
At low altitude these are likely to be on the ground. If these are
discovered at high altitude they could be levitating towers, built upon
cloud banks, suspended by squadrons of hot air balloons, or whatever
else the referee desires. Whether these will be friendly or unfriendly
can be determined with a
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check.

### Aerial Encounters

Encounters occur in the air much as they do in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
The referee should check once each day with a throw of a 6 on a
six-sided die indicating an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters).

When an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
occurs determine the type of
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) by dicing on
the appropriate
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
table. If the players are traveling at low altitude the
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
is equally likely to occur on the surface as on the wing. In this case
use the appropriate
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
table.

#### Surprise

Surprise occurs in the air (as it does in the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration))
with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. If the players are surprised
their enemies will typically come at them from upwind or above, emerge
suddenly out of clouds or rain squalls, or emerge from the dazzling
glare of the sun.

#### Encounter Distance

If either party is surprised an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be
unable to respond for one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns); otherwise, an
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
will begin at 40-240 yards distance.
[Melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2) range is 1" (10
yards) as it is in the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration).
Airborne artillery range is typically 300 yards.

#### Monster Reaction

Monster
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
to the players on the wing is as per the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration).

### Evasion and Pursuit

Evasion and
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) on
the wing is as per the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
with the following additional considerations:

-   Low [visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility)
    occurs in [storms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1),
    rain, clouds, looking into the sun, and at night,
-   Evaders who can [fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly) will
    automatically escape pursuers on the ground without this ability
    unless they are surprised.

### Aerial Combat

Players with winged mounts or other means of flight can engage in
[aerial](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#aerial-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). Excepting [air
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-air), larger
creatures are clumsier fliers than are smaller creatures. Climbing is
slow and diving is fast.

When air-to-air [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
occurs, the referee should use the
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) (1" to 10 yards and
one minute [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)) to
resolve maneuvering and
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire as the
protagonists engage. Altitude,
[wind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strong-winds) direction,
tactical positions, and facings can be marked on a
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) map, if desired, or
simply noted as closing
[distances](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3).

#### Missile Fire

Airborne artillery may be fired every other
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), while
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) and
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) may be
loosed each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) giving due
consideration to air [speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed)
and [weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weather) conditions.

Large creatures can bombard ground targets by dropping rocks, logs,
bodies, or similar
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) from above.
These are treated as artillery attacks.

Missile fire from the air is always considered to be at long range and,
against [aerial](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#aerial-exploration)
targets, attack rolls are penalized by −4.

A [mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat)
[heroic-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) is
subject to [missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire)
fire only on a six-sided die throw of 5-6; otherwise his mount is
subject to that
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire. Should
a rider be hit he is unhorsed with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die and
will [fall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#falling). Otherwise, a
hit to his mount will maim a critical flight muscle with a throw of 6 on
a six-sided die and cause it to crash to the ground.

#### Melee

Aerial melee attacks are made in passing clashes at a range of 1" (10
yards) with combatants being disengaged after each pass. Should a
combatant lose the
[initiative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#initiative) he is
unable to riposte that [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
unless his [speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed) and
heading match his opponent’s, or the combatants are otherwise held
together.

### Falling

Falling or otherwise crashing is a constant hazard for fliers. A fall to
earth from a low altitude will cause 1-6
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) (1-6 to 6-36 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)). A
fall to earth from a high altitude will cause 10-60 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) after 1-4
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) (minutes) free
falling.

## The Campaign

#### Specialist Hirelings

Specialists are the elite category of
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings) whose
services are only available to the wealthy. Specialists are engaged to
undertake specific tasks and must be paid for a minimum of one month.

##### Alchemists

can duplicate [potions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions)
from a sample or a proven formula at one-half the
[potion’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions) regular cost.
They can also
[research](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#researching-new-spells)
new [potions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions) (including
[poisons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#neutralize-poison)
although use of
[poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#neutralize-poison) is an
evil act) at double the cost of a
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
equivalent spell
[research](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#researching-new-spells).

##### Animal Trainers

are necessary to train any non-domesticated creatures. An animal trainer
can train one specific type of creature and no more than six such
creatures can be trained at any one time. The duration of any training
will be determined by the referee.

##### At least one Armorer

is required to maintain the arms and
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) of every
50 [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter). While
otherwise idle an armorer can fashion up to three
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or two
[helms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) per week, one
suit of mail
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) in a
month, or one suit of plate
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) in two
months. Two assistant
[smiths](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#at-least-one-smith) will
double this volume. Six assistant
[smiths](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#at-least-one-smith) will
triple this volume.

##### Assassins

can be found only rarely; no more than 1-6 are available in any game
year. Success is determined by the referee according to the power and
precautions taken by the subject. Hiring an assassin is considered an
evil act.

##### An Engineer

is required for the construction of any bridge,
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds), or other
fortification. They are also required to undermine fortified walls and
for any tunneling or mining.

##### Marines

are sea-faring fighters. In ship-to-ship
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) they are equivalent
to [mercenaries](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-mercenaries);
they wear only leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and are
never [mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat).

##### A Sage

is a master of esoteric knowledge who can function in an advisory
capacity.

##### Sailors

are required to [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) any
sea-faring ship. In ship-to-ship
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) they are equivalent
to [buccaneers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-buccaneers).

##### A Ship’s Captain

is required to effectively run any sea-faring
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels), maintaining
order, discipline, and sea worthiness.

##### At least one Smith

is required to maintain horseshoes, harness, buckles, axles, wheels, and
so on for every 50 [horses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses).
While otherwise idle a smith can fashion one score
[arrow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#arrows-and-bolts) heads,
four [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears), two
[axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes) or swords, or a single
two-handed sword per week.

##### Spies

can be found only rarely; no more than 1-6 are available in any game
year. These are used to infiltrate, eavesdrop,
[shadow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shadows), and spy for the
obtaining or planting of information or trinkets. Success is determined
by the referee according to the precautions taken by the subject.

### Constructing a Stronghold

A wealthy character may wish to construct a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) such as a
[keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep), tower, castle, or
whatever is affordable. If he has reached 9th level he is always allowed
to establish this
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds);
otherwise, he will require permission from the regional ruler. Depending
upon the character’s
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment),
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma), and political
prospects, such permission may not always be forthcoming.

Monsters must be cleared from within three hexes (18 miles) of the site
before any construction can commence. Once a fortification has been
established, however, the surrounds will remain clear of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) so long as
they are patrolled satisfactorily.

The region within three hexes of a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) (37 hexes
total) will typically contain 2-8 villages of 100-400 inhabitants; these
and other features can be determined by the referee using the random
[wilderness](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-exploration)
hex tables. If the occupier of a
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) is at
least 9th level he is entitled to collect 1 gp per month from each
inhabitant for their protection.
[Clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) may collect an
additional 1 gp per month for spiritual donations where alms are
provided and services conducted.

These revenues may be used by the player to swell his personal treasury
or to further his fledgling realm with roads, bridges, fortifications,
inns, churches, animal husbandry, or whatever else. How these activities
will influence the character’s reputation and his political prospects is
for the referee to decide.

Below are the costs of common structures though any variation in size
should adjust costs proportionately.

##### Arrow Slit

Any fortified opening through which
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) can be
discharged including murder holes and oilettes.

##### Barbette

A 10ft diameter, 20ft tall [round
tower](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tower-round) section which
protrudes where battlement walls intersect, enabling archers to fire
through [arrow slits](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#arrow-slit).

##### Barbican

A pair of 30ft diameter, 40ft tall crenulated towers with a 40ft section
of [curtain wall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curtain-wall)
between them having battlements facing both inward and outward. The wall
may be serviced by a gate with
[portcullis](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#portcullis) and
[drawbridge](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#drawbridge) (at
additional cost).

##### Bastion

[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) with a complete crew.

##### Catapult, Light

A siege engine that lobs rocks up to 300 yards for 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage), firing every
second [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) with a complete
crew.

##### Cauldron

enabling defenders to pour boiling water or oil over the walls.

##### Curtain Wall

A 100ft long section of 15ft high crenulated castle wall.

##### Ditch

A 100ft long section of 10ft deep and 20ft wide diggings. Fills with

[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) walls.

##### Stairs, Stone

Up to a 10ft rise or fall of internal or external stone steps.

##### Stairs, Wooden

Up to a 10ft rise or fall of internal or external wooden steps.

##### Tower, Round

Up to 20ft diameter, 30ft tall round tower with crenulated battlements.

##### Tower, Small

Up to 15ft diameter, 40ft tall [round
tower](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tower-round) with crenulated
battlements.

##### Tower, Square

Up to 30ft square, 30ft high tower with crenulated battlements.

##### Window

A glass covered frame for admitting
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2), up to 3ft square.
Can be opened for better
[visibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#visibility).

### Mass Battles

Strongholds may need to defend themselves or the surrounding territory
from hostile or ambitious neighbors. Political intrigues, sieges, and
field battles are all possible. While the
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) rules herein can
resolve actions involving large bodies of troops, the referee may desire
to employ purpose-made wargaming rules for
full-[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) fantasy battles.
Suitable rules for these engagements include “Chainmail” (1971), “De
Bellis Fantasticus—Here There Be
[Dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)” (1998), and “The
Book of War” (2011).

### Artifacts

Super powerful magic items aligned toward law, neutrality, or chaos
might exist at the referee’s option. These potentially game-altering
objects are known as artifacts and should be handled by the referee with
great care.

Artifacts are unique,
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) specific
objects that have a
[purpose](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#purpose) and a history. An
artifact could be a throne, an extra-dimensional gate, a crown, a suit
of mechanized
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), an
enchanted ship, a sword of seven shards, or anything else the referee
desires. They will be the subject of
[research](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#researching-new-spells)
and controversy among the wisest and may also be known through folklore
to the common [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).

Whatever its nature, an artifact is impervious to ordinary magic.
[Anti-magic
shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#anti-magic-shield), [remove
curse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#remove-curse), [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic), [dispel
evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-evil), and so on are
completely ineffective. Moreover, an artifact is almost completely
indestructible. There is typically only one specific way to destroy an
artifact which invariably involves a great
[quest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#quest) to some faraway and
dangerous place.

Consequences for meddling with an artifact of differing
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) should be
severe. Death, insanity, extra-dimensional imprisonment, 10-60 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage), loss of 1-6
experience levels, or similar would not be unreasonable. The power
imbued when employing an artifact appropriately should be equally
astonishing and this matter is left entirely to the referee’s
imagination...

### Enchanting Magic Items

Magic-users and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can copy
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
which they can memorize onto
[scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls)
and can enchant other magical items at 9th level or higher. Items with
spell-like powers that mimic
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) can
only be constructed by members of that
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes); other magic items
can be created by either
[class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).

The referee can extrapolate cost and time requirements for other items
commensurate with their power and value. Invest wisely.

### Other Worlds

There are countless other
[worlds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) to
explore that might be reached by magic or by other ingenuity. Moreover,
the inhabitants of these unfathomable places might reach the here and
now of the [campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign)
at any time, or may have been present from the very beginning.

Visiting other planets, other times, or other dimensions are very real
possibilities and the players might discover paths to abyssal depths,
Elysian delights, or virtually any other place at any time. The
possibilities are truly endless.

Should the players reach other
[worlds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) these
should be remarkably different from our own. The assumed natural laws of
gravity, time,
[space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required),
temperature, inflammability,
[scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale), and so on should not
all apply. In this regard the wealth of science fiction and fantasy
literature can be a great inspiration to the referee.

# Section III: Monsters & Treasures

## Monsters

Monsters are the principal challenge that players will face in their
adventures. They include all the genuine horrors of the
[underworld](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#underworld-exploration)
such as [trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls),
[vampires](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vampires), and
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons), as well as all
the non-player characters of the
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world). Every
character that is not run by a player is a monster—even the good
townsfolk and the players’
[hirelings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hirelings).

It is clear then that not all monsters are harmful to the players. Some
are quite benign and may even be helpful. Others are completely
disinterested in the players so long as they don’t get in the way, while
yet others are villainous threats that will seek to slay, capture, or
waylay the players. A monster’s initial disposition toward the players
is determined by a
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check and its
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment). This
characteristic is a one word summary of any monster’s stance in the
eternal struggle between law, chaos, and neutrality.

### Summary of Monsters

##### Number Appearing and Number in

Lair are the numbers of
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) typically
encountered outside of or in their lair, respectively. A + indicates the
possibility of leader-types and/or accompanying
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2). The number
of [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) appearing
outside the lair is appropriate for 4-6 characters whose experience
level is equal to the
[monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) number of
[hit dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
The referee can [scale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) these
figures for smaller or larger groups or as desired.

##### AC

is for [armor class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee).

##### Movement Rates

are given in inches per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). The first figure
denotes the normal ground rate. If a secondary rate appears it denotes
the flying, [swimming](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming),
burrowing, or climbing rate as per the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) description.

##### HD

lists the number of [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) with
any adjustment to [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
being applied after the given number of six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) have been thrown
and summed.

##### Lair Nearby

is the percentage chance that any encountered
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) will be from
a nearby lair. “Nearby” is
[relative](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#relatives) to the
[monster’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) usual mode
of locomotion. Whether the lair is easy or difficult to locate is for
the referee to determine.

##### Treasure Type

is for determining what
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) will be
present in the lair. A \* indicates the possibility of additional
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) as per the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) description.

##### Alignment

L is for lawful, N is for neutral, and C is for chaotic. Some
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) can be of any
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)
([men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) being among these) and
others can be either of two
[alignments](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)
([elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) and
[kobolds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#kobolds) being among
these). In all these cases any individual is always of exactly one
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment).

## Explanation of Monsters

Wherever special melee
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) is detailed it is
applicable to [heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) only. However,
against
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types),
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) throw one
attack roll as a 1 [hit
die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice)
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) for each of
their own [hit die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice), with
each successful attack roll causing 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

Monster [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) are as the
most appropriate player-type with as many experience levels as the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) has [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). For
example, an [android](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#androids)
would save as a 2nd level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user), a
[troll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls) would save as a 6th
level [fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter), and so
on. A [gothrog](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gothrogs) would save
as a 10th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)/10th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user), using
whichever category is more favorable.

##### Androids

are artificial [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). They
often have superior qualities such as health, grace, comeliness, or
education, but are otherwise indistinguishable save for the color of
their blood. Some individuals possess mind powers equivalent to magic
use of up to the 4th experience level (throw a six-sided die and
subtract 2 for each android—a result less than 1 indicating no tangible
mind powers); otherwise, they function as do ordinary
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).

##### Ants, Giant

are 2-3ft long. They are industrious tunnelers and gatherers that occur
in great colonies. Outside the lair only the soldier types will be
encountered. Within the lair two-thirds of any ants encountered are 1
[hit die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice) workers that
will not attack unless provoked. The remainder are soldiers that will
attack anything that obstructs the business of the colony. A nest always
has a 10 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) queen
ant who is immobile and non-aggressive.
[Giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) ants will never flee
from their nest unless the queen is slain.

##### Apes

are generally non-aggressive but are extremely strong. They will climb
trees for refuge but if provoked they can strike for 2-7 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Basilisks

are large, slow, eight-legged reptiles whose gaze or touch will petrify
any living creature that fails to save [versus
petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).
If it is tricked into seeing its own reflection in a mirror, a basilisk
will likewise be petrified.

##### Bats

roost underground in great numbers during the day. They are mostly
harmless to [man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)
but if a colony is startled and takes to the wing in a confined
[space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required) they will
create confusion. A flapping cloud of
[bats](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bats-giant) will obscure
sight and possibly extinguish torches, cause
[equipment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#equipment) to be
dropped, or cause spell
[casting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
to be interrupted.

##### Bats, Giant

are black as night and so silent on the wing that they will
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) their prey with
a throw of 3 or more on a six-sided die. If their prey resists they will
shriek, causing
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) to
cover their ears for one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) rather than fight.

##### Bears

are omnivorous but favor meat. They have rather poor eyesight but an
excellent sense of smell and can scent food from miles away. They can be
aggressive hunters and are very powerful. They cause 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Beetles, Giant

are of various sorts but are invariably hungry and can eat virtually any
organic matter. They occur underground and in forests and can tunnel
through soft earth. They do not hear or see well and rely on their
sensitivity to vibrations and smell.

##### A Black Pudding

is an amorphous black blob which
[moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) about a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
scavenging the leavings of other inhabitants. Due to its coloration and
shapelessness it is very difficult to spot in dim
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) or shadows. It is
susceptible to fire but invulnerable to cold. Lightning and slashing
attacks will divide it into smaller parts without causing harm. Contact
with a black pudding will dissolve wood and metal
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) in one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Flesh is likewise
dissolved suffering 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Stone, however, is
impervious. It can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) along
walls, floors, and ceilings without difficulty and can squeeze through
tiny openings including cracks in stonework and under
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors).

##### Boars

are wild pigs that occur in forests and on plains. They are frequently
hunted for sport but are extremely tough; they always make one more
attack roll after being reduced to 0 or fewer [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
Every other boar encountered will be a sounder and if these young are
attacked the adults will always attack and will absolutely not flee.

##### Boars, Giant

are similar to regular
[boars](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#boars) but for their great
size and aggressive demeanor. They will attack anyone who enters their
territory causing 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). They will never
retreat and will always make one more attack roll after being reduced to
0 or fewer [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Cave Bears

are enormous carnivorous
[bears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bears) that are always
hungry. They have rather poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell
and can scent food from miles away. They are aggressive hunters and are
extremely powerful. They cause 1-11 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Cave bears will
always make one more attack roll after being reduced to 0 or fewer [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Cavemen

are large but primitive Neanderthal types who are otherwise similar to
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). They fight with crude
[axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes), hammers, and clubs,
but suffer a −1 adjustment to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks and have little
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures). Leader-types
are always [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)
but never possess magic items.

##### Centaurs

are
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses)-[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)
having the body of a [horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses)
and the torso of a human. They have normal human
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence) and
dwell in secluded glens and valleys in deep forests. Centaurs equip
themselves with [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears)
(25%), swords (25%), or clubs (50%) and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) with
half carrying short [bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) in
addition. Moreover, a centaur warrior can has two attack rolls each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), once each with his
weaponry and hooves. A centaur lair is much as a small human village
having two mares and two foals for every warrior stallion present. Mares
have one attack roll each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) only under duress and
foals are non-combative.

##### Centipedes, Giant and Large

are found almost anywhere and are aggressive hunters. Large specimens
are up to 1ft long, while the
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) types are up to 10ft
long and have a hard, armored head but a relatively soft body. Both
sorts [move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
along walls and ceilings at normal
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed). The bite of either
causes paralysis although a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is allowed and
is at +4 in the case of large centipedes.

##### Chimeras

are fearsome three-headed
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) with great
[bat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bats-giant)-like wings, the
forequarters of a [lion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions), the
hindquarters of a goat, and the heads of goat,
[lion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions), and
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons). A chimera can use
its [breath weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon)
or engage in [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). The
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) head breathes a 6"
long 2" wide cone of fire that deals 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage), although a
successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus breath
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) will reduce
this by half. In [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) a
chimera has three attack rolls each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) against
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) enemies; the
goat head butting or goring, the
[lion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions) head biting or rending
with its paws, and the
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) head biting.

##### Cockatrices

are reptilian-fowl with
[bat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bats-giant)-like wings. The
merest touch of its tail feathers will petrify any living thing (other
than a cockatrice) that fails to save [versus
petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).

##### Crabs, Giant

occur underwater, in coastal estuaries, and in swamps. They have hard,
armored shells and if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit
by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any case, they cause 1-11 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Crocodiles

are voracious reptiles found in rivers and swamps of warm regions. They
are difficult to spot when floating half-submerged in water and will
often attack by
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise). If an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more a crocodile will
drag its victim back into the water where it will roll over and over
until the victim is drowned. Crocodiles are lazy and will not
[pursue](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) more
than one [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) out of water.

##### Crocodiles, Giant

are thrice the size of their ordinary cousins but otherwise similar. An
attack causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and any attack roll
that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more swallows a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized victim whole. They
are difficult to spot as they float half-submerged in water and they can
overturn boats and rafts. A
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants)
[crocodile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#crocodiles) can be
rammed by larger ships, possibly slaying the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) but also
capsizing the boat (check separately for each).

##### Cyborgs

were once [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) but are now
mostly machines; inhumane and evil. They can occur in large numbers and
aim to sweep across a population assimilating all
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) into cyborgs.
They are cruelly strong and deal 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) on a hit, need
never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks),
and will never give up a
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) so
long as the quarry is in sight.

##### Cyclopes

are 20ft tall [giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) with
but one large eye which is the cause of poor depth perception and a −2
adjustment on all attack rolls. They dwell in forlorn, out of the way
ruins, islands, or undersea caves where they seldom
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)
others. They are skilled
[smiths](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#at-least-one-smith) and
should a player offer a useful gift and get a positive
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
the cyclopes may offer magical
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) in
return. A cyclops does battle with a huge club and deals 6-21 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and can hurl rocks
up to 20" for 2-12 [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).
They especially prize gold and their
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) hoard will
always contain an additional 2,000-5,000 gp.

### Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are great, prehistoric
[lizards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizards-giant-and-large)
and can be fearsome enemies. The largest predators are few but can
swallow [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized victims
whole while the smaller types occur in hunting packs. Herbivores of all
sizes appear in herds. None of them covets
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures).

##### Dinosaurs, Brontosaurs

are among the largest creatures walking on land. They are up to 80ft
long, 20ft tall at the shoulder, and can weigh over 30 tons. They spend
their time grazing the vegetation of the great plains and swamplands.
Fortunately, they are peaceful herbivores and unlikely to attack unless
provoked. The chief danger they present is from crushing, barging, or
stampeding ahead of predators or fire. Hits deal 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) due to their
immense mass.

##### Dinosaurs, Deinonychus

include any of the relatively small pack hunting carnivores up to 5ft
high and 10ft long. They are quick and cunning and inclined to stalk
prey, only attacking at the optimal moment. They will not give up a
[pursuit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#evasion-and-pursuit) while
their prey remains in sight.

##### Dinosaurs, Mosasaurs

are huge reptilian swimmers up to 40ft in length. These
[marine](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#marines)
[lizards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizards-giant-and-large)
have paddle-like limbs, finned tails, and huge jaws bristling with
curved teeth. They are found in any deep waters but must surface to
breathe air. A hit causes 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) but if ever an
attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20
in any case, a mosasaur will swallow a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized target whole.

##### Dinosaurs, Pterodactyls

are any [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized and larger
reptilian fliers that rule the prehistoric skies. They occur in coastal
and swampy regions where they nest in colonies that cling to cliff
faces, cave walls, and escarpments, and are always hungry. The most
common forms are approximately
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized with wingspans of
10-25ft but the largest sorts are up to 20ft tall with wingspans of up
to 40ft.

##### Dinosaurs, Stegosaurs

are large herbivores up to 30ft long and 10ft high and up to 3 tons in
weight. These have very tiny brains and a distinctive array of
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields)-like
plates along the ridge of the spine, granting AC 2 versus attacks other
than from the flank. They have a fist of 2ft long spikes on the tail
which will strike for 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to the flank or
rear; otherwise, [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) is
3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Dinosaurs, Triceratops

are huge, aggressive herbivores that will run down any threat to the
herd. They are up to 30ft long and 10ft high and can weigh up to 10
tons. A triceratops has a huge skull with a distinctive bony frill and
three great horns granting AC 2 from the front. Should it charge an
enemy it will deal 4-24 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage); otherwise,
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) is 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

##### Dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus Rexes

are huge carnivorous
[lizards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizards-giant-and-large)
and truly fearsome predators. They are up to 20ft tall and 40ft long and
can weigh up to 7 tons. The jaws contain scores of
[dagger](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers)-like fangs and any
hit causes 4-24 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). On any attack roll
that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any
case, it will swallow a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized target whole.

##### A Djinni

is a creature of air appearing as a supremely confident, bare-chested
warrior. They can [fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly) as
easily as walk, even burdened with thrice what an ordinary
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) could bear. A djinni can
become invisible, assume [gaseous
form](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gaseous-form), or magically
create any desired object at will. Soft materials including food, drink,
and garments are permanent. Harder materials have a shorter existence;
djinn gold lasts only a day, steel only an hour. A djinni can also
create magical
[illusions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions) on a whim and
these are equal to the
[phantasm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#phantasm) spell except
that a djinni has no need to concentrate to maintain the
[illusion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions).

A djinni can also transform into a torrid whirlwind 3" high and 2" wide
which will sweep away all
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types). The
whirlwind takes one [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to
form and another to dissipate. A djinni deals 1-11 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) due to his
formidable size and
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength).

##### Dogs

are keen nosed pack animals that inhabit plains and prairies. They can
be trained only if separated from the pack as pups but will then have +2
[loyalty](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#retainer-loyalty).

##### Doppelgangers

are humanoid creatures that can change their physical form to
identically resemble any
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-like creature they have
observed. Once a likeness is achieved they can do away with the victim
and then act in his role for a time to gain the utmost advantage before
attacking again. Doppelgangers are immune to
[sleep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sleep) and charm spells and
make [saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws)
as a 10th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter).

##### Dragon Turtles

are 30ft diameter turtles with long, sinuous necks and
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) heads. They are
found only in large bodies of water and lair in deep, underwater
grottos.

A [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) turtle has a
9"×3" conical [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) of scalding
steam which functions as does a
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon). It can
surface beneath even a large ship, having a 50% chance of capsizing the
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels).

### Dragons

Dragons are the great flying wyrms of
[legend](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#legend-and-rumors) and are
always
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types),
regardless of [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). They
are of six types: white, black, green, blue, red, and golden and have
the following characteristics:

White [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) are the
least intelligent sort and have the usual 20% chance of knowing the
common tongue and no possibility of magic use. [Golden
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-golden) are the
most intelligent sort and they always know the common tongue and always
have the use of magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells). The
other [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) have
various chances of speaking the common tongue and only 10% chance of
being magic-using.

All [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) have six life
stages: hatchling, young, adult, mature, old, and ancient. The size of a
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is determined
according to its life stage, as is the possibility of a
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) being asleep if
encountered in its lair. Note that even a wakeful
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) may appear to be
sleeping.

All [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) can sense
hidden and invisible creatures within 6". From adulthood they are
impervious to [normal
missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-missiles) and need
never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).
Old and ancient [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)
require [normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
to throw a positive
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check to approach nearer than 15" or to hold their ground if the
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) attacks.

##### Sleeping Dragons

Should a [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) be
sleeping the characters may, if great caution is employed, approach
without waking it. If this is successfully accomplished a single
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) attacks is
allowed at +2 to hit. These will wake the
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) immediately and
thereafter regular [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
will ensue.

##### Dragon Breath Weapon

A [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) can use its
dreaded [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) only thrice
per day and will do so to its maximum advantage. Those unfortunates that
are targeted suffer [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
equal to the [dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)
current [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) or
half this number with a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus breath
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon).

##### Dragon Magic

Should a [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) be
magic-using it will know as many
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) as
it has [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice). It
will have access to 1st level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) as a
hatchling, 2nd level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) as a
young [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons), and 3rd
level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
thereafter. [Golden
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-golden) only
continue in this manner, attaining 6th level
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) as
ancient [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons).

##### If Multiple Dragons

are encountered they will be related individuals of the same type. A
pair of [dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) could be
siblings, mother and daughter, or a mated pair as appropriate for their
age category. Hatchlings and young
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) will be the
offspring of adults present. If these are attacked, the adults will
immediately use their [breath
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) against the
offender. If either adult of a mated pair is attacked, its mate will
retaliate at +4 to hit the following
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or for the remainder
of the [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) if its mate
is slain.

##### Subduing Dragons

With the exception of the golden type,
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) can be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue) as
usual. A
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue)
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) will serve so long
as its master remains in a commanding position but will otherwise
attempt to escape or slay him. A
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue)
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) can be sold into
servitude on the open market for 500-1,000 gp per [hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) it
has—although the player may have difficulty finding an appropriate
buyer.

##### Dragon Treasure

Hatchlings have not yet acquired any
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures). Older
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) have a hoard
worth ½ a type H
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) for each age
category beyond hatchling.

##### Dragons, Black

dwell in swamps, marshes, and jungles. They are patient hunters and can
[fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly),
[swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming), and breath
underwater indefinitely. While a black
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) lurks underwater
the pool will gradually stagnate and become foul. Its [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is a searing
jet of acid which affects all targets in a line. They are themselves
invulnerable to acid.

##### Dragons, Blue

are found in arid regions soaring on the hot desert airs. They are
shrewd hunters and love best to drop unseen from the azure skies but can
also bury themselves in sand dunes for ambush. A blue
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is a cracking
[bolt](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#arrows-and-bolts) of
lightning which will affect all targets in a line. They are themselves
invulnerable to lightning.

##### Dragons, Golden

can be found in any habitat. Despite being the only lawful
[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) they will not
serve any player and cannot be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). They are very
intelligent and always magic-using and will employ
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells)
cleverly in [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).
Moreover, they are highly magic resistant and make all [saving
throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) versus
magical attacks at +4. A gold
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is a sonic
blast that will also
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) structures. They
sometimes [polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#polymorph)
into human form to
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) freely
among [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).

##### Dragons, Green

are found in daunting woods and impenetrable forests. They are voracious
hunters of food and
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) and keen
gatherers of intelligence. They will attack weak targets immediately but
stalk more formidable prey. A green
[dragon’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is a
withering cone of chlorine gas. They are immune to
[poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#neutralize-poison).

##### Dragons, Red

dwell in mountain caves from where they terrorize the surrounds. They
are voracious predators and their greed is legendary. They will usually
attack on sight but prefer not to destroy
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) with their
fearsome fiery [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) if possible.
They are themselves invulnerable to fire.

##### Dragons, White

dwell in polar regions and are cunning predators that can
[fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly),
[swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming), and tunnel through
snow and ice. They will not slip on ice and their [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) is a
blistering cone of cold. They are themselves invulnerable to cold.

##### Dryads

are shy and reclusive creatures who have exhaustive knowledge of their
forest homes. Each is bound to an individual tree and can go no farther
than 24" from it. A dryad is non-violent but can employ a powerful charm
causing a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) at −2. Those who fail
will never leave the forest.

##### Dwarfs

dwell underground and see equally well by day or by night. They are
redoubtable [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)
and [ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres),
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls), and
[giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) score only half
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) against them. Away
from the lair a troop of dwarfs is always accompanied by one 1st-6th
level [fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) for
every 40 dwarfs. In their
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) lair there
will instead be one 3rd-6th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) for every 40
dwarfs. A leveled
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) has a 10%
chance per level of being equipped with magic
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), a magic
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), and a
magic [axe](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes) or hammer (check
separately for each). A dwarf
[stronghold](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strongholds) is 50%
likely to be additionally defended by domesticated animals such as 1-6
[bears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bears) or 1-8 [giant
weasels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#weasels-giant) (check
separately for each).

##### An Efreeti

is a creature of fire and an irreconcilable enemy of the
[djinn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-djinni). They are
immensely strong—being able to bear what eight
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can carry—and deal 2-12
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). Efreet can also
[fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly), become invisible, and
magically create any desired object at will. Soft materials including
food, drink, and garments are permanent. Harder materials have a shorter
existence; efreet gold lasts only a day, steel but one hour. An efreeti
can also create magical
[illusions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions) on a whim and
these are equal to the
[phantasm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#phantasm) spell except
that an efreeti has no need to concentrate to maintain the
[illusion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#illusions). Additionally
they can cause a [wall of
fire](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wall-of-fire) to spring up and
can themselves become incendiaries. If bound into service an efreeti
will grudgingly serve for a year and a day but no longer.

### Elementals

An elemental is an essential force of nature and is one of four types:
earth, air, fire, and water. Each can appear in three sizes: 8, 12, or
16 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
Elementals of any sort are affected by magical weapons only.

All elementals, no matter the [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) or
type, must be controlled by the summoner. If the summoner’s
concentration is broken for any reason the elemental will cease whatever
it is doing,
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at its
best [speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed), and attempt to
kill him. Anyone between the elemental and its summoner will be attacked
and everyone else will be ignored. Once control has been relinquished
there is no way to regain it. The elemental will attack until it or its
target is destroyed and immediately return to its home dimension.

##### Elementals, Air

The only means of motility possessed by an air
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) is flight
but they have absolute control over their
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2),
hovering or changing [speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed)
at will. These
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) cause 2-7
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and attack at +2 to
hit versus
[aerial](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#aerial-exploration)
opponents. They can spin into a fearsome whirlwind 3" wide at the base,
6" wide at the apex, and 1" of height for each [hit
die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice) possessed (e.g., 8"
tall for an 8 HD air
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals)). The
whirlwind takes a [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to
form and another to dissipate and will sweep away all
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types).

##### Elementals, Earth

These creatures of earth and stone will strike with their mighty fists
for 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to opponents
standing on solid ground and causing structural
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to constructions
such as castle walls. Against opponents not standing on solid ground an
earth [elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals)
inflicts 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Earth
[elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals)
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) at 6"
over or through earth but cannot cross water. A [move
earth](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#move-earth) spell will drive
an earth [elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals)
back 12" and cause 6-36 points of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Elementals, Fire

Fire [elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals)
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) 12" per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) but cannot cross
water. The touch of these
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) causes
inflammable materials to ignite. In
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) a fire
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) usually
causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Against other
fire-based creatures ([red
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-red),
[salamanders](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#salamanders), [fire
giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants-fire), and so on)
they cause only 2-7 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Fire
[elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) can only be
summoned from a large source of heat such as a bonfire, a furnace, or
molten lava.

##### Elementals, Water

Water [elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) are
very dangerous in their environment, causing 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in the water but
only 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) on dry land. They
can overturn boats and small
[vessels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) and prevent
large [vessels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) from
moving. Water
[elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) can only be
summoned from a large body of water such as a stream, pond, or lake.
Once formed, a water
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) must remain
within 6" of a large body of water. Its [movement
rate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#movement-rates_1) is 18" in
water but 6" out of water.

##### Elves

are reclusive woodland folk. They can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) silently
and almost invisibly through woods in their gray-green cloaks and are
equipped with swords and
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) or swords and
[bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) (50% chance of either).
For every 40 elves encountered there will be a leader-type with 2-4
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) levels and
2-6 [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
levels. For every 80 elves encountered there will be an additional
4th/6th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)/[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user).
Leader-types may possess magic items as per
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). All elves add +1 [hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) when employing
magic weapons and those with
[bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) and fire
without penalty.

##### Fish, Giant

are of various sorts including barracuda, gar, and pike. They are
aggressive hunters and always hungry. They occur in wild schools and as
domesticated guardians around
[merman](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mermen) and
[nixie](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#nixies) lairs.

##### Gargoyles

appear much as the sculptural depictions in gothic architecture. They
can remain perfectly still indefinitely and are indistinguishable from
ordinary statues when so perched. They are notoriously hostile, however,
and will attack without provocation 75% of the time. They are fond of
ambush and [normal
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) do them no
harm.

##### A Gelatinous Cube

is a cube-shaped, transparent scavenger that shapes itself to fit
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
corridors up to 10ft by 10ft wide and
[moves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) about
sweeping them clean. It picks up and absorbs everything from rocks and
carrion to living things and
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), which it is
unable to digest. Thus, these scavengers carry a miscellany of durable
items (coins, gems,
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers),
[helms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms), and so on)
suspended in their transparent innards. Contact with a gelatinous cube
causes paralysis unless a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is made, and
thereafter causes 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) as the flesh is
digested. They are invulnerable to cold and lightning, and immune to
[fear](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fear), paralysis, and
[polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#polymorph).

##### Ghouls

are eaters of living and carrion flesh. Their attack rolls and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks are penalized by −2 in daylight but the touch of these undead
creatures causes paralysis for 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) (except
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1), who are immune). A
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) slain by a
ghoul will arise again the following night as a ghoul.

### Giants

Giants are enormous, ugly humanoids who can hurl great rocks 20" for
2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and need never
check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
against [man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types).
Unless noted otherwise, giants also cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). A wandering giant
carries a great shoulder sack that contains his possessions including
rocks, prisoners, other miscellany, and 1,000-6,000 gp worth of coins.
Giant lairs are 50% likely to be guarded by a 5-10 headed
[hydra](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hydras) (with a throw of 1-4
on a six-sided die), or 2-20
[wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves) (with a throw of
5), or 1-6 [bears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bears) (with a
throw of 6). Giants are of various sorts including:

##### Giants, Cloud

are 18ft tall and inhabit unbelievable castles among the clouds. They
cause 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) and their sense of
smell is so amazingly keen that they are rarely surprised.

##### Giants, Fire

are 12ft tall and of stocky build. They cause 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) and lair in castles
and caverns wherever there is lava, fire, or great heat. They are
themselves invulnerable to fire.

##### Giants, Frost

are 16ft tall and cause 3-13 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). They favor huge
horned [helmets](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) and
lair in frigid castles and caverns. They are themselves invulnerable to
cold.

##### Giants, Hill

are the most base sort. They are 12ft tall and lair in rudimentary
caves. They frequently associate with
[ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres),
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs), and other wicked
creatures.

##### Giants, Stone

are 14ft tall and inhabit isolated mountain cavern systems. They hurl
rocks for 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Giants, Storm

are 20ft tall and cause 6-21 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat). They inhabit
formidable castles situated in out of the way places including islands,
mountains, and cloud tops. They are able to [control
weather](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#control-weather) to create
stormy conditions—which they will do when angry or expecting battle. As
well as hurling rocks a
[storm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#storms_1)
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) can call down a
lightning strike for 8-48 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in thunderstorm
conditions. They are themselves invulnerable to lightning.

##### Gnolls

fight with +2
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).
The lair will contain a chieftain and 1-6 bodyguards who fight as 4 and
3 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively.

##### Gnomes

are found in Arctic climes. They are smaller and more reclusive than
their cousins, the
[dwarfs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1), but have longer
beards and bigger noses.

##### Goblins

are small, malicious humanoids who operate underground or at night,
adjusting attack and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks by −1 in full daylight. Each fighting goblin carries coins worth
1-6 gp with him, even outside the lair. The lair will be a cave complex
containing as many non-combatants as combatants, as well as a goblin
king and 4-24 bodyguards who fight as 2 and 1+1 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively. The lair is 50% likely to contain an additional 3-12
[giant wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves-giant) and
3-18 [ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres) (check
separately for each).

### Golems

Golems are powerful automatons created by high level
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) that exist
only to obey the commands of their creators, following instructions to
the letter. They are ponderous and dull-witted but incredibly strong. In
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) they strike for
2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and can batter
through wooden structures including
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors). They are largely
invulnerable to harmful magic, but there is a 1% chance per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) that a golem will
go berserk. Should this occur the creator cannot regain control and the
golem will continue to attack whatever creature harms it or is nearest
until it is destroyed.

##### Golems, Clay

are created by high level
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) from blood and
pliable clay. A
[disintegrate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#disintegrate) spell
will [slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) a clay
[golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems) and cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and a [move
earth](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#move-earth) spell will drive
a clay [golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems) back 12" and
cause 6-36 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage); otherwise, they
can only be harmed by magical weapons. After one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) a clay
[golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems) comes under the
influence of a [haste](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#haste) spell
for the next three [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).
Injuries caused by a clay
[golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems) cannot be cured by a
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) lower than 9th
level.

##### Golems, Flesh

are powerful automatons created by high level
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) from
stitched together body parts, but they are not undead. Cold and fire
based
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) will
[slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) a flesh
[golem](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#golems) and lightning will
[heal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#healing) it; otherwise, they
can only be harmed by magical weapons.

##### Gorgons

are aggressive, bull-like creatures covered in iron
[scales](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#scale) with a rightly
feared [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) that turns
targets to stone. The [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon) extends to a
6" long by 2" wide cone and is usable thrice per day.

##### Gothrogs

are [giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants), fiery fiends of
dreadful power and
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence). They
see in darkness as [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) see in
daylight and combust inflammable materials by merely passing nearby.
Fire and [normal
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) cannot harm
them and it is 75% likely that magic
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) will
not affect them.

Gothrogs carry great, flaming, [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) and fiery
whips and can attack with either or both each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Should a gothrog
employ both weapons it can target two opponents, causing 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to each. If it
employs only one weapon it does so at +2 to hit. The flaming sword
causes 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). The whip causes
only 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage), but entangles the
target so the gothrog can drag him unto itself, where upon it will
immolate and cause an additional 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to everybody within
1".

Gothrogs need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
and cannot be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue). A
powerful chaotic character might attempt to
[enlist](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#enlisting-monsters) one
with a substantial offering, but only a top level
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) has
the presence necessary to
[keep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#keep) a gothrog firmly under
control. A gothrog would ever be bent upon usurping the authority of any
other master.

##### Gray Ooze

is a creeping
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
scavenger which is difficult to spot in dim
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) as it appears much
like wet stonework. It can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) along
walls, floors, and ceilings equally and can squeeze through tiny
openings including cracks in stonework and under
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors). It dissolves metal
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) in one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) and causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to flesh but has no
effect on wood or stone. It is impervious to cold and fire but subject
to lightning and [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) (but note
its effect on metal).

##### Green Slime

is a pernicious
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
hazard that clings to walls, floors, and ceilings. It begins to eat
through flesh, wood, and metal (but not stone) after one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of contact,
transmuting these into green slime. It cannot be physically scraped off
so anything it comes into contact with must be discarded immediately. It
is impervious to lightning and physical blows but is harmed by cold and
fire. A [remove
disease](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#remove-disease) spell will
slay it instantly.

##### Griffons

are majestic creatures with the forequarters of an eagle and the
hindquarters of a [lion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions).
They are fleet and fiercely territorial and will attack without
provocation should anything approach the aerie lair. Griffons make loyal
steeds if they can be trained but crave
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) flesh above other
foods and will attack any
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) or
[pegasi](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#pegasi) within 36".

##### Halflings

are small, peaceful folk interested chiefly in home comforts. When the
need arises they are able to
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) silently
and almost invisibly and to hide quite superbly. For every 30 halflings
encountered there will be a leader with 1-4
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) levels. All
halflings are deadly accurate with hurled
[missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) adjusting
attack rolls by +3.

##### Hippogriffs

are admirable beasts with the forequarters of an eagle and the
hindquarters of a [horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses).
They are omnivorous hunters and highly sought as mounts for their great
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed)—despite their
intolerance of [pegasi](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#pegasi).
They need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
when defending their nest.

##### Hobgoblins

are the largest and most fearless
[goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins). They are
armored, well organized, and have +1 to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks except in full daylight where they must instead adjust attack
rolls by −1. Wandering bands are always led by a sergeant who fights as
a 2 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

The lair will be a village, ruin, or cave complex containing half as
many non-combatants as combatants as well as a hobgoblin king and 2-12
bodyguards who fight as 3 and 2 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively. The lair is 50% likely to contain an additional 3-12
[giant wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves-giant), 3-18
[ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres), and 2-12
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls) (check separately
for each).

##### Horses

are domesticated riding animals and beasts of burden. Riding horses,
draft horses, and mules will flee fire and may be panicked by strange
smells. Only warhorses and destriers will attack in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), having a single
attack roll even versus
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types).

Only [mules](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses) are agile
enough to enter the labyrinthine passages of a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon).

##### Hydras

are large reptilian
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) with one head
per [hit die](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hit-dice). Each
serpentine head can be destroyed by sustaining 6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). The entirety of
the beast is slain only when all of its individual heads are dispatched.
Circumstances allowing, each head can select an individual target and
make an attack roll each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). However, it attacks
as a [fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) rather
than as a [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

##### An Invisible Stalker

is a creature from the null-dimensions which can be conjured to the
material [world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world)
by powerful magic. It is indistinguishable from air without the benefit
of a [detect
invisibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#detect-invisibility)
or a [true seeing](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#true-seeing)
spell. It is a faultless tracker and, if encountered in the material
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world), an
invisible stalker will be single-mindedly preoccupied with whatever
mission it is carrying out.

##### A Juggernaut

is an incredibly massive creature of solid ore, though whether it is
self-willed or magically motivated is unknown. These behemoths have only
ever been sighted individually and can take any form; a great armored
knight, a mammoth, and a rhinoceros have all been reported. A juggernaut
is so massive that it is impelled upon huge stone rollers with anything
falling in its path being crushed utterly beneath it.

Regardless of its form a juggernaut always has a massive dark jewel
affixed to it; between the eyes, in the chest, or atop a
[helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms),
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands), or sword,
and so on. The jewel glows with an eerie
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) and can
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
out a [slaying spell](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slaying-spell)
each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or an improved
[hold person](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hold-person) spell
which will affect 2-12
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) who save at
−2 or a single [man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types)
who saves at −6. Unfortunates so held will soon be crushed beneath the
juggernaut. If the jewel is somehow removed from a juggernaut it has no
magical properties but is worth 20,000-120,000 gp.

If it comes to blows a juggernaut deals a crushing 5-30 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). It is impervious
to most magical attacks and can only be harmed by magical weapons of +3
or better quality. A juggernaut need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
and cannot be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue).

##### Kobolds

are small, cowardly, reptilian humanoids who dwell in quags and
wetlands. They are able swimmers and prefer to attack in great numbers
from ambush. Each fighting kobold carries coins worth 1-6 gp with him,
even outside the lair. Their lair will be a marshy cave complex
containing as many non-combatants as combatants as well as a kobold king
and 5-30 bodyguards who fight as 1+1 and 1 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively. The lair is 50% likely to contain an additional 3-24
[crocodiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#crocodiles) and 2-12
[giant
lizards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizards-giant-and-large)
(check separately for each). Their
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks are adjusted by −1 unless they are defending their lair and they
outnumber their enemies by 3 to 1 or more.

##### Leeches, Giant

are loathsome swamp parasites that will attach to victims on a
successful attack and drain one experience level in the
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) after attachment and
another every other [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
thereafter until either the victim or the leech is slain.

##### Lions

are the great cats of the plains. They occur in hot to tropical climates
and are territorial hunters who will stalk prey patiently in order to
attack by [surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise). They
can leap 30ft forward but dislike climbing and
[swimming](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming). They cause 2-7
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Lions, Spotted

are similar to regular
[lions](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions) except that they are
larger and occur in caves and mountainous regions. They cause 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

### Living Statues

Living statues are large, powerful humanoid automatons. Standing
silently they are indistinguishable from ordinary statues of great size.
Living statues are extremely heavy and
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2)
ponderously but with purpose. They can batter through wooden structures,
including [doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors), and are
largely invulnerable to harmful magic.

##### Living Statues, Iron

are
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
from solid metal. In
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) they can exhale a
1" radius cloud of
[poisonous](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) gas or else
strike for 4-24 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Lightning attacks
will [slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) them and fire will
[heal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#healing) them; otherwise,
they can only be harmed by magical weapons of +3 or better quality.

##### Living Statues, Stone

are hewn from solid rock. In
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) they can
[slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) one target per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or else strike for
3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Cold and fire will
[slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) them and [stone to
flesh](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#stone-to-flesh) will
[heal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#healing) them; otherwise,
they can only be harmed by magic which specifically affects stone or
magical weapons of +2 or better quality.

##### Lizards, Giant and Large

are found in desert and jungle climes. Large lizards can be up to 6ft in
length and [giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) lizards
up to 15ft. Both types have superb camouflage markings and can hold an
absolutely still position indefinitely. If a
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) lizard should throw
an attack roll of 20, its bite will clamp onto its prey and not let go,
automatically causing
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) thereafter until
either it or its prey is slain.

##### Lizardmen

are reptilian humanoids with
[crocodile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#crocodiles)-like jaws
and tails and a rudimentary
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence). They
employ primitive [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears)
and clubs and will capture as many humans as possible—returning with
them to their lair for a tribal feast.

The lair will be a wet or marshy cave complex containing half as many
non-combatants as combatants as well as an equal number of
[kobolds](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#kobolds) and 2-16
prisoners. There will be a lizardman chieftain and 1-6 bodyguards who
fight as 4 and 3 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively. There is also a 33% chance that the lair will contain 2-12
[giant
lizards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lizards-giant-and-large),
3-24 [crocodiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#crocodiles), or a
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) (check for each
separately). If a [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)
is present it will be an adult, mature, or old specimen of the black or
green type.

##### Lycanthropes

are also known as werebeasts and are of various sorts. All are
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) afflicted
with lycanthropy and cannot be harmed by [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) unless it
is silvered. Any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) seriously
wounded by a lycanthrope will become one of the same type at the next
full moon unless he receives a [remove
disease](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#remove-disease) spell
before this occurs.

Outside the lair werebeasts run in packs of 1-10 adults. If more than 8
are encountered in the lair one-third will be adults with the remainder
being non-combative young. A lair will also contain animals of the
appropriate type (1-6 [bears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bears)
for werebears, 1-12 [boars](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#boars)
for wereboars, 1-6 [tigers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tigers)
for weretigers, or 1-10
[wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves) for werewolves). If
the young are attacked adult females will retaliate at +4 to hit for the
remainder of the [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).
If females are attacked the adult males will retaliate at +4 to hit
thereafter. If all adults are slain the young are automatically
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue).

##### Manticoras

are great [lion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lions)-like beasts
with [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)-wings,
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-like faces, and powerful
tails that culminate in 24 iron spikes which can be flung in a volley of
6 at any target within 18". These are carnivorous and favor human flesh.

##### Mastodons

are proto-elephants encountered on open plains in any climate. They
occur in herds and are generally non-aggressive unless threatened or in
the mating season. At these times the males will attack anyone who might
dare to approach the herd. They cause 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) due to their
prodigious size.

##### Medusae

have the lower body of a great serpent and the upper body of a woman,
except that their hair is a tangle of deadly venomous
[snakes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#snakes-giant-and-large). So
abhorrent is a medusa’s appearance that anyone who meets its gaze will
be turned to stone unless he makes a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).
Any medusa who sees her own refection will likewise be turned to stone.

### Men

Men are of various sorts and lair in villages, caves, hide-outs,
encampments, and so on.
[Brigand](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-brigands) and
[buccaneer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-buccaneers) lairs
will have 2-12 prisoners who will always be persons of some importance.
[Bandit](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-bandits) and
[pirate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-pirates) lairs will
have 3-30 prisoners of any sort. A
[nomad](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-nomads) encampment is
always guarded by an additional 20-40
[nomads](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-nomads) on foot.

Each individual man will have 2-12 sp on his person (in addition to
whatever [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) may
be found in the lair) except that
[pirates](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-pirates) and
[buccaneers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men-buccaneers) have
2-12 gp each instead. For every 25, 50, and 100 men encountered there
will be an additional leader who is a 3rd-4th, 5th-6th, or 7th-8th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter),
respectively. If at least 200 men are encountered it is 50% likely they
are also accompanied by a 5th-8th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and a
3rd-6th level [cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
(check separately for each). If 300 men are encountered there absolutely
will be an additional 9th-12th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and an
additional 7th-10th level
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric).

Leader-types have a chance of possessing magical items appropriate to
their [class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#classes).
[Fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) have a 10%
chance per experience level of possessing a [magic
sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) and are half as
likely to possess a magic
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or magic
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).
[Clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) are 2% likely
per experience level to possess a magic
[mace](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flails-and-maces),
[flail](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flails-and-maces), hammer,
or [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) and are
5% likely to possess a magic
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or magic
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).
[Magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) are 5%
likely per experience level to possess a magic
[wand](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) and are
equally likely to possess a magic
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) or a [miscellaneous
magic
item](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#miscellaneous-magic-items).
Check separately for each item in all cases.

##### Men, Bandits

are desperate and surly scavengers equipped simply with clubs,
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers), or
[axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes), and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).

##### Men, Berserkers

are warriors maddened with battle lust. They attack at +2 to hit [versus
man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#versus-man-types) and
need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).
They carry two-handed weapons but wear no
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields). Their
leader-types are exclusively
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter).

##### Men, Brigands

are well-organized robbers and highway
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). They wear leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), carry
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), are
armed with swords, [axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes),
[maces](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#flails-and-maces), short
[bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows), or
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) and have a +1
adjustment to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks.

##### Men, Buccaneers

are picaroons and castaways who ply the shores for easy pickings from
skiffs and pickets. They are unarmored and quick and carry swords or
clubs and [daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) as a
main gauche.

##### Men, Dervishes

are religious fanatics of the lawful sort. They attack at +2 to hit
[versus man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#versus-man-types)
and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
due to their fanaticism. They carry clerical weaponry and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and
their leader-types are exclusively
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric).

##### Men, Mercenaries

are professional sell-swords and soldiers of fortune. They are well
organized but untrustworthy military
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) possibly open to offers
of employment. They typically have leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields),
[helmets](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms), and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and are
armed with swords, [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears),
pole arms, or crossbows. With a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die
one-third of their force will also be
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat).

##### Men, Nomads

are desert or steppe raiders who are always
[mounted](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mounted-combat). They
carry short [bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows),
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears), and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields).

##### Men, Pirates

are ruthless sea [dogs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dogs) and
cut throats who pillage waterways and coastal regions from their sloops
and galleys. They are unarmored and quick and arm themselves with curved
swords or clubs and
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) as a main-gauche.
They have a +1 adjustment to
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks.

##### Men, Zealots

are religious fanatics of the chaotic sort. They attack at +2 to hit
[versus man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#versus-man-types)
and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
due to their fanaticism. They carry clerical weaponry and
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and
their leader-types are exclusively
[anti-clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric).

##### Mermen

are aquatic warriors. Against
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) in the sea
they attack at +2 and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).
They can remain underwater indefinitely and are only subject to
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) fire if they
rise to the surface, which they must do to grapple or board ships. On
land or aboard ships they suffer a −2 penalty to attack rolls and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks. Their scaly skin is equal to leather
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) and they
fight with [spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) and
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers). Meremen have
leader-types as do [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)
although these are exclusively
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter).

##### Minotaurs

are great bull-headed humanoids half again as large as a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). They are carnivorous
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-eaters and will always
attack. They need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
and will never give up a chase so long as the prey is in sight.

##### Mummies

are invulnerable to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) and even
magical weaponry causes them only half
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). They are
vulnerable to fire, however, even the ordinary sort. A hit from a mummy
will cause a terrible necrosis such that wounds take 10 times as long to
[heal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#healing). The first and
second applications of a [remove
disease](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#remove-disease) spell will
reduce this to 5 times and 2 times, respectively, and only a third
application will lift the affliction entirely.

##### Nixies

are small and comely fresh water sprites who are not evil but will
compel intruders to serve their needs. Any 10 nixies can jointly
[enchant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#enchanting-magic-items) a
target with a [charm
person](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charm-person) and a water
breathing spell. A character who fails to save [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) will immediately
proceed to the underwater lair and remain there in servitude. After a
period of one year he will return to the surface unharmed. A [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic) can prematurely
break the enchantment but always has a 25% chance of failure.

Nixies arm themselves with
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) and javelins.
Their lair will be an underwater enclave containing 2-16 charmed
prisoners of various sorts, and protected by 20-120 [giant
fish](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fish-giant) such as gar or
pike. These will obey nixies but can be held at bay by any fire that
will burn underwater. Any group of 40 or more nixies can attempt to
grapple a surface ship.

##### An Ochre Jelly

is a monstrous amoeba that lives as a
[dungeon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon)
scavenger. It is susceptible to cold and fire but lightning and weaponry
will merely divide it into two smaller parts without causing it harm. An
ochre jelly will dissolve a wooden
[shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or
[door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors) in a single
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Flesh contacted
suffers 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) but stone and metal
are impervious. It can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) along a
wall, floor, or ceiling equally and can squeeze through tiny openings
including cracks in stonework and under
[doors](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#doors).

##### Octopi, Giant

are intelligent and lair in shipwrecks and caves preying on passing
swimmers and ships. They can grapple and capsize smaller
[vessels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) or else
make 1-6 attack rolls each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) versus
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
enemies with their stinging tentacles. They have no bones and can
squeeze through very small gaps.

##### Ogres

are thick-necked, ugly brutes half again as large as a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) and possess great
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) but limited
wit. They cause 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) due to their size
and [strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength). They are
so suspicious of their fellows that little
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) is left
unguarded. Instead, each ogre carries 100-600 gp with him even outside
of the lair.

##### Orcs

are fecund humanoids occurring in warlike tribes. They dislike bright
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) and adjust attack
and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks by −1 from in full daylight. Hostilities among orc tribes are
just as common as with neighbors of other sorts and they will attack
foreign orcs unless restrained by a strong leader. They need not check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
while they are defending their lair and they outnumber their enemies by
at least 3 to 1.

An orc lair will be either a guarded cave complex or a village protected
by a stockade and possibly an encircling
[ditch](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ditch) or moat. The lair
will contain half as many non-combatants as combatants as well as an orc
chieftain and 3-18 bodyguards who fight as 3 and 2 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2),
respectively.

A village is 33% likely to contain an additional 1-4 catapults, a high
watch tower, 1-8 [ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres), a
7th-8th level
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter), and a
9th-12th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) (check
for each separately). A cave complex is 33% likely to contain additional
dead [falls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#falling) and other
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps), 1-8
[ogres](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres), 1-6
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls), or a
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) (check for each
separately). If a [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)
is present it will be a young, adult, or mature specimen of the black,
green, blue, or red sort.

##### Pegasi

are shy, wild, and noble winged
[horses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses). If captured they
are difficult to tame and will not tolerate
[hippogriffs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hippogriffs) or
griffins. They will never serve chaotic characters.

##### Pixies

are small air sprites who are permanently invisible unless they desire
to be seen. They are not evil but dislike intrusion and any 10 pixies
can jointly cause a [sleep](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sleep)
spell once per day which they use to dissuade potential offenders. They
arm themselves with
[daggers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) and short
[bows](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) and always attack by
[surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) unless they are
detected by magical means. Note that
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) of 8th level
and above will sense pixies within 3" even without seeing them.

##### Purple Worms

are voracious burrowers up to 6ft in diameter and 60ft in length that
occur almost everywhere. They always attack and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).
A purple worm causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and has a deadly
venomous stringer in the tail but the huge maw is the main weapon; if a
bite attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is
a 20 in any case, a [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized
or smaller target will be swallowed whole. Swallowed targets will be
unconscious within 3 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns),
slain within 6 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), and
the body unrecoverable after 12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). The interior gullet
is AC 9 but can be attacked only by
[dagger](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#daggers) or knife; at least
12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) must be caused to
cut a way out.

##### Rats, Giant

occur in plague proportions underground, squeezing through tiny gaps and
tunnels in the earth and stone work. They cause only 1-3 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) but any hit can
transmit a debilitating disease to
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) who fail to
save [versus poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) at +4
on the die (a single [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) being required
per
[encounter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wilderness-encounters)).
Unless commanded to fight by a
[vampire](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vampires) or
[lycanthrope](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lycanthropes) they
have −2
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
and will flee from fire.

##### Robots

are complex metal automatons with unfathomable electronic brains. They
are self motivating and semi-intelligent and can be negotiated with to
some extent. They are usually set on a “program” from which they will
never waiver. Robots are cruelly strong and will strike for 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Many can
[fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly) by one means or another
and the remainder are equipped with a disintegration ray which can be
fired up to 6" thrice per day. A successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays) is required
to avoid the beam. Robots cannot be
[subdued](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#attacking-to-subdue) and
need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).

##### Rocs

are gargantuan raptors that prey on cattle,
[horses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses), and even
elephants. Their eyesight is peerless and they always spot hidden (but
not invisible)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types), even from
high altitude. The largest rocs are so fearsome that
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) must check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
if attacked. Rocs lair in remote, mountainous aeries that are difficult
to approach except on the wing. Those found in the lair will be of mixed
life stages and there is a 50% chance that there will also be 1-6
unhatched eggs or fledglings.

Eggs and fledglings can be trained to serve as mounts if they can be
captured. If the nest contains these, the mature
[rocs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rocs) will attack anyone who
approaches and never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks);
otherwise, the mature [rocs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rocs)
will tolerate lawful characters and possibly even help them. Chaotic
sorts can expect only a hostile
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).

##### Sabre Toothed Tigers

are the great cats of the Pliocene epoch, capable of hunting down
[dinosaurs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dinosaurs). They are
half as large again as ordinary
[tigers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tigers) and every bit as
canny and agile. They cause 2-9 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Salamanders

are fire-types possessing high
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence), the
upper body of a [man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men), and the
hind section of a great serpent. They employ
[spears](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spears) and pole arms and
can be found in lava fields and environs of intense heat. Their touch
causes inflammables to combust and 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to non-fire
creatures. In [melee](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee_2)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat) the upper body is
AC 5 while the serpent section is AC 3. Opponents who are not fire-types
suffer an additional 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) with each hit.
However, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or
more, a salamander instead constricts with its burning tail for 2-12
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) (plus 1-6
additional [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to
non-fire creatures). They are themselves invulnerable to fire and
[normal weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons).

##### Scorpions, Giant

are extremely aggressive hunters of
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses)-sized proportions.
They sense things mainly through vibration in the earth and will always
attack anything that approaches. An attack roll that exceeds the number
required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any case, indicates a hit by
the venomous stinger, which is fatal unless a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) is successful;
otherwise, it is assumed to be a pincer attack that deals 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Sea Monsters

include the largest sea serpents, the whale-like leviathan (which has
reportedly been mistaken for an island), and the many-tentacled kraken
(which is confined to a null dimension unless it is called forth by an
evil high priest to devour shipping and seaports). These exist
principally as deadly perils to be avoided.

If the players insist on rousing sea
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) to
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), sea serpents will
cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and swallow
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized or smaller targets
whole as per [purple
worms](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#purple-worms) and can
encircle longboats and smaller ships within their coils and destroy them
in 1-6 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). The kraken
can capsize any ship in 1-2
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or else deliver 1-6
attack rolls versus
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
enemies, each dealing 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). The leviathan can
capsize 1-3 ships in near proximity in a single
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or swallow a single
ship whole in its vast maw—destroying the
[vessel](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels) and
delivering 4-24 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to everyone aboard
as it swallows them.

##### Shadows

are bleak incorporeal spirits that hunger for the life energy of living
things and drain 1-4 points of
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) on a hit. They
are impervious to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) unless it
is silvered, but magical weapons will do them double
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) reduced to nil
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) by a shadow is
slain and will arise on the following night as a shadow.
[Strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength)
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost) is otherwise
recovered at 1 point per hour.

##### Skeletons

are mindless undead brought forth by a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) to
serve some wicked purpose. These can carry
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or wear
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), or both,
which would improve AC to 7 or 6, respectively. They are unaffected by
[normal missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-missiles),
require no sustenance, and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).

##### Snakes, Giant and Large

are encountered almost anywhere. Large snakes are up to 10ft long but
are generally non-aggressive unless hunting or provoked; they are 50%
likely to be venomous.
[Giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) snakes are more
aggressive and are of two sorts: vipers and constrictors. Vipers slither
silently and are deadly venomous. Constrictors are non-venomous and
their bite bite deals only 1-2 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). However, if
attacking by [surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise) or
an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, a
constrictor instead encircles its target, crushing
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) for 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Constrictor-types can
also be encountered at sea and are capable of encircling and destroying
small boats within their coils in 1-6
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Spectres

are malevolent, incorporeal spirits. They can
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) through
walls, ceilings, and floors and are impervious to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons). Their
attack is a withering grasp that drains two experience levels on a hit.
A [man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) slain by a
spectre will arise the following night as a spectre under the control of
the [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) that
destroyed him. Any additional spectres encountered will be thralls of
this sort.

##### Spiders, Giant and Large

occur commonly in
[dungeons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon).
Large spiders are the size of a
[man’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) hand and can scurry
over floors, walls, and ceilings equally. Their bite is venomous but a
[saving throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws)
[versus poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) is allowed
at +2. [Giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) spiders are
true horrors up to
[horse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#horses)-sized. Their bite is
deadly venomous and they are
[web](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#web) builders—these being
equal to a [web](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#web) spell in
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength). They prefer to
wait patiently in ambush and attack unwary victims. They will flee to a
dark retreat if faced by superior opposition.

##### Squid, Giant

are voracious deep sea predators who will occasionally come to the
surface to grapple and capsize passing
[vessels](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#oared-vessels). They make
1-6 attack rolls each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
against
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
enemies with their numerous tentacles. If seriously challenged they can
expel a cloud of black ink and flee backwards at triple pace for three
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Tigers

are great cats that occur in frigid to tropical woodlands. They are
canny, agile, and superb hunters who will stalk prey patiently in order
to attack by [surprise](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#surprise).
They can climb and [swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming)
and can leap 10ft upward or 40ft forward. They cause 2-7 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) or, if an attack
roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any
case, 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Thulls

are frightful humanoids similar to feral
[hobgoblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#hobgoblins) in
appearance but they are far more dangerous. A thull will regenerate 1
[lost hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) at
the beginning of each [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
and a scratch from its black nails will cause paralysis for 1
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) (except
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) who are immune).

##### Titanotheres

are enormous herbivores that roam temperate plains and wetlands in
herds. Normally peaceful, they will charge and trample anything that
provokes them causing 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) due to their great
size.

##### A Titan

is a most handsome and civilized
[giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants). They are at least
as intelligent as [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men), thrice
as tall, and incredibly strong. They deliver 6-21 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) with their enormous
weapons and have the use of any two
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of
each spell level per day. A titan lair will contain an additional
3,000-18,000 gp.

##### Toads, Giant

will swallow
[halflings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#halflings_1) and smaller
folk whole on any attack roll that exceeds the number required to hit by
4 or more. They can hop 18" every other
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns),
[swim](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#swimming), breath underwater,
and are 50% likely to be venomous.

##### Treants

are 20-30ft tall tree-[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).
They are guardians of the ancient forests they inhabit and have little
interest in the affairs of short-lived races such as
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men). If roused they are
dangerous enemies and will deal 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). They are
invulnerable to [normal
weapons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) and suffer
one-half [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) from
magical weaponry other than
[axes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#axes) but are vulnerable to
fire. Thrice per day a treant can awaken any other tree within 6". An
awakened tree fights exactly as another treant without the ability to
awaken others.

##### Trolls

are thin, loathsome humanoids with rubbery green skin. They would be
tall if they were not always hunched over. They have
[ogre](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres)-like
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) but rarely
employ anything more than tooth and claw so cause only 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). They regenerate 3
[lost hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns), beginning three
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) after injury,
enabling even severed limbs to reattach or re-grow. The only way to
permanently slay a troll is to burn its remains or immerse it in acid.

##### Unicorns

are fierce, noble, magical steeds. They are reclusive creatures who will
tolerate contact only with a maiden of pure heart. If she is a valorous
warrior a unicorn may consent to serve as her steed, using its horn as a
lance when it charges. A unicorn saves as a 12th level
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user), is
able to sense enemies within 24", and can [dimension
door](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dimension-door) up to 36" once
each day.

##### Vampires

are dreadful and intelligent blood-sucking undead. Fortunately, they
must sleep during the day in a coffin containing soil from their
homeland. They are impervious to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) and
regenerate 3 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) if injured. If reduced
to 0 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
they are not slain but forced to assume [gaseous
form](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gaseous-form) and flee. They
can [polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#polymorph) into
[gaseous form](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gaseous-form) or a
[giant bat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bats-giant) at will and
can call forth and command 10-80
[bats](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bats-giant), 2-12 [giant
rats](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rats-giant), or 1-10
[wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves).

Any [man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) enduring
eye contact with a vampire is subject to a [charm
person](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charm-person) spell with a
−2 adjustment to the [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws). Once a victim
is charmed the vampire can bite at the neck with impunity, draining two
experience levels per [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns)
of gorging. Any
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)/[superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) so slain by a
vampire will arise the next night as a vampire enslaved to the
[monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) who made him.
Others so slain arise instead as
[ghouls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ghouls). Vampires are
destroyed only by direct sunlight, immersion in running water, or a
wooden stake through the heart. They can be held at bay by a strongly
presented Cross, the smell of fresh garlic, or the face of a mirror.

##### Weasels, Giant

are cunning hunters adept at moving through tunnels and crawl
[spaces](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required) in fierce
packs. When an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or
more a [giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants) weasel bites
and holds on, gorging on the victim’s blood and draining him of 1-4 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) the following
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) and each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) thereafter, until it
has sapped 1 point for each of its own [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
Any victim reduced to nil
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) is slain.

##### Wight Apes

are so called for their pale coloration and dread demeanor. They occur
in small bands in dense jungles and around ruined catacombs. They are
larger and more aggressive than regular
[apes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#apes) and have a taste for
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-flesh. Worse yet, they
possess a malign cunning employing rocks and stones as tools and their
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) is such that
they cause 1-11 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) on a hit.

##### Wights

are accursed undead that drain one experience level on a hit. They
dislike [light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) and their
attack rolls and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks are penalized by −2 in daylight. They are impervious to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) unless it
is silvered, but magic weapons will do them double
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) slain by a
wight will arise on the following night as a wight.

##### Wolves

occur primarily in cold regions and hunt in packs.

##### Wolves, Giant

includes dire [wolves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wolves) and
wargs, both being larger than their
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) kin. Wargs
are especially cunning and evil and are 20% likely to speak the common
tongue and always speak the chaotic tongue. They can be ridden by
[goblins](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#goblins) although this
will reduce either to 12"
[movement](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) and
a single attack roll each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) even versus
[normal-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types).

##### Woolly Mammoths

are enormous, hairy, elephant-like mammals that occur in herds in arctic
regions. They are more aggressive than
[mastodons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mastodons) and are
invulnerable to cold. They cause 3-18 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) by charging,
trampling, crushing, or goring with their mighty tusks.

##### Woolly Rhinoceroses

are enormous, hairy, rhinoceros-like mammals that occur in arctic
regions. They have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and are inclined
to attack anything that approaches or spooks them. They are invulnerable
to cold and cause 4-14 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) by charging,
trampling, or crushing.

##### Wraiths

are dreadful undead that exist more in the spirit
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) and less
in the physical. They dislike
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2) and their attack
rolls and
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
checks are penalized by −2 in daylight.
[Normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types)
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) must check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
immediately if attacked by a wraith, while evil sorts fighting alongside
one receive +1 on their
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1). They drain one
experience level on a hit. They are impervious to [normal
weaponry](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-weapons) unless it
is silvered, although silver weapons will do them only half
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) slain by a
wraith will arise on the following night as a wraith.

##### Wyverns

are [dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons)-like
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) with only one
pair of legs, no [breath
weapon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#breath-weapon), and a deadly
venomous stinger in the tail which is very agile and can strike all
around. An attack roll that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or
more, or is a 20 in any case, indicates a stinger attack; otherwise, it
is a bite and claw attack that causes 3-8 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Yellow Mold

is a deadly fungus found clinging to walls, floors, and ceilings
underground. It is impervious to most attacks and can only be
exterminated with fire. It dissolves wood in one
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) and causes 1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) to flesh but has no
effect on metal or stone. If it is disturbed there is a 50% chance a
toxic spore cloud will burst forth causing
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) within 1" to
save [versus poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison) or die.

##### Zombies

are mindless undead brought forth by a
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) or
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) to
serve some wicked purpose. These can carry
[shields](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields) or wear
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields), or both,
which would improve AC to 8 or 7, respectively. They are unaffected by
[normal missiles](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-missiles),
require no sustenance, and need never check
[morale](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks).

## Treasures

### Treasure Types

When a [monster](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) lair is
discovered it will contain the
[monsters’](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2)
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) hoard (if any)
according to its stated
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) type. The
referee should [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1)
for each category of
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) (copper,
silver, gold, etc.) separately, firstly checking to determine if the
category of [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) is
present in the hoard and secondly, if it is present, to determine
quantity.

The percentage figures are the chance that the category will be present
and the range figures are quantites. For example,
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) have [treasure
type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasure-types) C so there is
a 17% chance their lair will contain 1,000-12,000 cp, a 33% chance their
lair will contain 1,000-4,000 sp, a 33% chance their lair will contain
1-4 gems, a 33% chance their lair will contain 1 piece of jewelry, and a
17% chance their lair will contain 2 items from the “Any
[Treasures](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)” table.

Note that [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) do
not carry [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)
outside their lair unless stated otherwise in the [explanation of
monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-monsters).

The value of gems and pieces of jewelry are individually determined.

Where maps or specific types of magic items are indicated the referee
should [dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) on the
appropriate [treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures)
tables.

## Explanation of Treasures

Maps reveal the location of a
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) trove which
may contain valuables, or magic items, or both. A map will indicate the
type and approximate worth of the
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures), which can be
determined randomly or by the referee. A map will usually be cryptic or
obscured—requiring the use of a [comprehend
languages](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#comprehend-languages)
spell or the expertise of a canny
[thief](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used) to decipher. The
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) indicated
therein will be guarded by appropriate
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) and/or
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

### Armor and Shields

A suit of magical armor or an enchanted shield will reduce an opponent’s
attack rolls by an amount equal to its adjustment. Thus, a suit of plate
armor +1 will cause enemies to attack at −1, a shield +2 will cause
enemies to attack at −2, and so on. If a character wearing magical armor
also carries an enchanted shield of greater potency, its greater
adjustment is applicable on any
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) he throws a 5 or 6 on
a six-sided die.

### Miscellaneous Magic Items

These items are usable by all characters unless noted otherwise.

##### Amulet of Proof Against Detection

An amulet that blocks all forms of magical detection including by
[crystal ball](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#crystal-ball),
[locate object](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#locate-object),
[detect
invisibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#detect-invisibility),
[sixth sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense), and
[witch eye](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#witch-eye). It is
ineffective against mundane detection, however.

##### Bag of Holding

An amazing sack that can hold up to 10,000 coins and appear only
partially full and weigh only 50 lb. Anything not wider than 3ft × 3ft
can be fit into it.

##### Boots of Elvenkind

Elvish footwear that enables the wearer to
[move](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#time-and-movement_2) almost
completely silently.

##### Boots of Levitation

Empowers the wearer to
[levitate](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#levitate) as per the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) spell
of the same name but with unlimited duration.

##### Boots of Speed

Anyone so shod may run at up to 24" for a full day after which he must
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) for a day.

##### Boots of Striding and Springing

The wearer can sustain his full
[speed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#speed) indefinitely without
need of [rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting).
Furthermore, thrice per day he can make a great leap up to 6" forward or
2" directly upward or backward, landing soundly on his feet.

##### Cloak of Displacement

The wearer of this cloak appears slightly displaced in time and
[space](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#space-required) adding +2 to
[saving throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws)
[versus wands and
rays](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays) and adjusting
physical attack rolls by −2.

##### Cloak of Elvenkind

A wondrous cloak that renders the wearer nearly invisible.

##### Crystal Ball

Employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only,
these provide vision of a desired place, person, or object. Great
[distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3) and
unfamiliarity will decrease the chance that the subject can be located,
however. Except as noted below, the other senses will remain
unsatisfied.
[Spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) such
as [read magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#read-magic),
[darkvision](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#darkvision), and
[detect
invisibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#detect-invisibility)
will affect what may be seen but no spell or spell-like effect can be
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
through a crystal ball. Most crystal balls enable only
[clairvoyance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#clairvoyance) but 1
in 6 will also permit the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) to hear
thoughts exactly as does the [sixth
sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense) spell. These may
be used no more than thrice per day without risk of being
[feebleminded](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#feeblemind) and each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of usage requires a
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of
[rest](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#resting) thereafter.

##### Drums of Panic

This pair of great drums are too large to be carried by a
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) but may be
transported on a wagon or beast of burden. When beaten these drums will
panic all living things at least 2" but not more than 12" away.
[Heroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) are
allowed a [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell) to resist;
[superheroic-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
are unaffected. Panicked creatures will flee at their fastest rate for a
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Efreeti Bottle

The [efreet](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-efreeti) trapped in
this bottle will grudgingly serve whomever should free him (and no
other) for a year and a day.

##### Flying Broomstick

This magical broom is employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only
and can [fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly) at 24" per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) with one rider, or at
18" per [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) with two
riders.

##### Flying Carpet

Can carry one or two riders at 24" per
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) or three riders at 12"
per [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Gauntlets of Ogre Power

The wearer of these gains
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) equal to an
[ogre](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ogres), enabling him to
perform feats of great
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) and to deal +2
[hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice)
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).

##### Girdle of Giant’s Might

The wearer of this wide leather girdle gains
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) equal to a
[hill giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants-hill). He is
capable of mighty feats of
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) including
hurling rocks and dealing 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) in
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).

##### Magical Helms

are not considered to be
[armor](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields). They do
not adjust [armor class](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#melee) and
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) are
not restricted from wearing them. Should these be worn in battle the
referee may assume that 1 blow in 6 is aimed at the head. If that blow
should connect the helm is struck and requires a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) to avoid being
smashed.

##### Helm of Alignment Change

If worn, this [helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms)
immediately causes lawful persons to become chaotic and vice versa.
Neutral persons are 50% likely to change either way. Removing the
[helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) thereafter
will not revert the subject’s
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)—this can only
be accomplished by [a wish](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wishes).
Of course the affected person will resist such efforts to the utmost of
his
[ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities).

##### Helm of Comprehend Languages and

Magic The wearer can read any magical inscriptions,
[treasure](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treasures) maps, and
mundane writing.

##### Helm of Telepathy

This [helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) enables
the wearer to probe subjects within 9" in exactly the same manner as the
[sixth sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense) spell.
Additionally, the wearer can implant a mental suggestion in any
intelligent subject so sensed. If a suggestion is attempted the referee
throws a
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check for the subject, adjusting the result by +2. A positive or better
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
indicates that the subject will enact any reasonable (according to his
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)) suggestion.

##### Helm of Teleportation

This [helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) grants
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only
the ability to
[teleport](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#teleportation) up to
three times per day as per the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) spell.
If the [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
also has the
[teleport](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#teleportation) spell
memorized that spell will not be erased from memory when
[cast](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-casting-from-memory)
for so long as this
[helm](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magical-helms) is worn.

##### Horn of Blasting

A blast upon this great horn delivers 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to all living
things within a cone-shaped area of effect 10" long and up to 3" wide.
Survivors are deafened for a
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) and any
[buildings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#building) or
fortifications suffer structural
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

##### Medallion of Thoughts

Grants the wearer use of the [sixth
sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense) spell except
that there is 1 chance in 6 it will fail to perceive any particular
subject.

##### Mirror of Life Trapping

A [shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#armor-and-shields)-sized
mirror that
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) any
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) or undead who
sees his own reflection at 1" or closer. It is 90% likely that an unwary
subject will see his reflection in good
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2), but only 10%
likely if he is wary of the mirror’s power. A
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
gaze into a mirror safely with a secret command word or the use of a
[gazeback](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#gazeback) spell. The
mirror can contain 15-20 prisoners at one time with each being held
individually in a private null dimension. Those so imprisoned remain
unharmed but are completely powerless therein. A
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) can
call any prisoner to the surface of the mirror to converse, and if
desired, can free them from the mirror. Breaking the mirror will free
all prisoners simultaneously.

##### Object of Commanding Elementals

These four objects are usable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only,
each conjuring an
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) of a
particular type. The conjuration requires a full
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) of preparation and
another of invocation. The
[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) brought
forth will then have 12 [hit
dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) and
be subject to the
[magic-user’s](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) will
exactly as per the [invoke
elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#invoke-elemental) spell.

-   Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
-   Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
-   Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
-   Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

##### Scarab of Protection

Affords the wearer absolute immunity from disintegration, finger of
death, level drain, [vorpal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vorpal)
swords, and [curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses). The
scarab will nullify 2-12 such attacks before crumbling to dust.

### Miscellaneous Weaponry

##### Arrows and Bolts

(50% chance of either) are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) only. The
magical adjustment applies both to attack and
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls. The attack
adjustment is cumulative with that of any magical
[bow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#bows) so a +1 arrow fired from
a +1 longbow would have a total attack adjustment of +2.

##### Axes

(50% chance of either battle axe or hand axe) are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) only. The
magical adjustment for battle axes applies to both attack and
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls, but that for
hand axes applies to attack rolls only. Hand axes can be hurled up to 3"
as a medium range
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) attack.

##### Bows

are equally likely to be crossbows, longbows, or short bows; all are
usable by [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)
only. The magical adjustment of these applies to attack rolls only.

##### Daggers

are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter),
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user), and
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used). The magical adjustment applies to attack rolls
only. The second adjustment (if given) is applicable to attack rolls
versus a specific type. Daggers can be hurled up to 3" as a medium range
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) attack.

##### Flails and Maces

are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric). The magical
adjustment applies to
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls only.

##### Morning Stars are

usable by [fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter)
only. The magical adjustment applies to
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls only.

##### Short Swords

are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and
[thieves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-thief-optional-class)
(if these are used). The magical adjustment applies to attack rolls
only. The second adjustment (if given) is applicable to attack rolls
versus a specific type.

##### Spears

are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) only. The
magical adjustment applies to attack rolls only but they can be hurled
up to 3" as a medium range
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) attack, and
three [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men) can fight in a
defensive spear wall across a 10ft wide passage. Spears can also be set
against a charging foe to cause 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) on impact.

##### War Hammers

are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) and the
magical adjustment applies to
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls only. These
can be hurled up to 3" as a medium range
[missile](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#missile-fire) attack.

##### War Hammer +3

In the hands of a
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) or
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) this weapon
adds +3 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) to
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). In the hands of a
[dwarf](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1), however, it
causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) against all foes
except [giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants), against
which it causes 5-15 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage). Additionally, a
[dwarf](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dwarfs_1) can throw the [war
hammer](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#war-hammers) +3 up to 6" and
it will automatically [fly](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fly)
back to his hand.

### Potions

A potion flask contains exactly enough fluid to cause the prescribed
effect, although a small sip may be tasted without altering its
efficacy. The duration of any temporary effect is 7-12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) unless stated
otherwise.

##### Abbreviation

Quaffing the full [potion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions)
will reduce a person to one-twelfth size. Thus, a 6ft tall
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) would shrink
to 6in. Consuming a lesser part will have a proportionally lesser
effect.

##### Animal Mastery

The imbiber gains control over 3-18 small animals, 2-12 medium sized
animals, or 1-6 large animals. Only

[dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons) who fail to save

by the referee.

##### Exaggeration

Quaffing the full [potion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions)
will enlarge a person to four times size. Thus, a 6ft tall

24ft. Consuming a lesser part will have a proportionally lesser effect.

##### Extra Curing

Quaffing the full [potion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions)
restores 6-21 [lost hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

type of [giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants), as
determined by the referee.

##### Giant’s Strength

Grants [strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) equal to
a [hill giant](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants-hill)
including hurling rocks and causing 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per hit.

##### Haste

Imbues the imbiber with the same effect as the
[haste](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#haste) spell except that it
lasts for 2-7 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Heroism

Causes an ordinary
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) to function as
a [heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types)

Produces the same effect as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
[polymorph](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#polymorph) spell except
that it lasts only 7-12

throws](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) versus
magical fire, including

dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-red) breath, by +2.
Any fire [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) sustained
is reduced by 1 [hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) per
die regardless.

##### Sixth Sense

Drinking this [potion](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#potions)
produces the same effect as the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) [sixth
sense](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#sixth-sense) spell for 7-12
[turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

##### Regeneration

Causes the wearer to regain 1 [lost hit
point](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns). Severed limbs will
reattach or re-grow. If the wearer is reduced to 0 (or fewer) [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) he
will even return from the dead if he makes a successful [shock
survival](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#shock-survival) check.

##### Spell Storing

A [ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) of this type can
store 1-6
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) of
either the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user),
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric), or
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) sort
with a throw of 1-4, 5, or 6 on a six-sided die, respectively. The
anti-clerical [rings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) are
harmful to [clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) and
vice versa. Whether there are stored
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) in
the [ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings), and what
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) they
are, should be determined randomly if such a
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) is found. Anyone
(including a non-spell caster) who places this
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) on his finger
immediately knows which
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells), if
any, are stored therein and may invoke them. Each stored spell can be
invoked once before it is expended. The
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) can only be recharged
by a [magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user),
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric), or
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric),
respectively.

##### Spell Turning

Any spell targeted specifically at the wearer of this
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) is 80% likely to be
turned back at the caster. For each experience level the spell caster
has beyond the 4th it is 10% less likely that his spell will be turned.

##### Telekinesis

The wearer is able to shift loads up to 200 lb at a rate of 12" to
anywhere within a 12" radius simply by concentrating.

##### The Djinn

The wearer may call forth a
[djinni](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-djinni) who is
permanently bound to serve whoever wears the
[ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings). The
[djinni](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-djinni) is as are all
[monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) of its type.

##### Water Walking

Enables the wearer to walk on water as if he were walking on dry land.

##### Weariness

The wearer is reduced to half his usual
[strength](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#strength) and is affected
by a [slow](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#slow) spell for so long
as he wears this [ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings). It
can only be removed by a [remove
curse](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#remove-curse) spell or [a
wish](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wishes).

##### Wishes

Grants either 3 or 1-6 (50% chance of either) wishes to the wearer. A
wish is powerful magic indeed but only the most literal interpretation
of a wish will be honored.

A wish must be uttered in one breath. It can be used to
[heal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#healing) a player, to restore
him to life, to lift
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses), to [dispel
magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dispel-magic), and so on.
[Ability](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-abilities)
scores can be restored to normal or raised by 1 point (up to 18). A
[lost](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#becoming-lost) experience
level can be restored but a new experience level cannot be added. Any
wealth or object brought to hand will come from the nearest source and
the rightful owner will not be pleased with this theft.

The referee should adjudicate the effects of a wish carefully. A wish
that all [orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) should die,
for example, might have no effect given that
[orcs](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) are mortal and will die
eventually in any case.

##### X-Ray Vision

Enables the wearer to see through up to 10ft of stone or 6in of iron to
a [distance](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#encounter-distance_3)
of 6". Everything will be revealed including
[traps](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#tricks-and-traps) and secret
places. The magic is obstructed by lead or gold and only a 1" × 1"
section of wall can be examined each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).

### Spellbooks and Scrolls

Scrolls are either [spell
scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls),
[wards](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wards), or
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses). Each type can be
identified by anyone who can read. [Spell
scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-scrolls) are usable
only by the appropriate magical types and
[curses](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#curses) are triggered as
soon as they are identified.

#### Spell Scrolls

Spell
[scrolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls)
are of the
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user),
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric), or
[anti-cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-anti-cleric) sort
when a 1-4, 5, or 6 is thrown on a six-sided die, respectively. A spell
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls)
will contain 1-3
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells) with
the level and name of each spell being determined randomly. A spell
invoked from a
[scroll](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spellbooks-and-scrolls) is
as per the minimum caster level necessary to memorize the spell.

#### Wards

Wards function as does the [circle of protection from
evil](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#circle-of-protection-from-evil)
spell except that they are effective against a specific type and number
of [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) and have a
duration of one hour.

##### Ward against Elementals

[elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals) of any type.

Effective against 2-12
[lycanthropes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lycanthropes) of any
type.

##### Ward against Magic

Effective against all magic in a 1" sphere about the invoker for one
hour in the same manner as the [anti-magic
shield](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#anti-magic-shield) spell.

##### Ward against Undead

Effective against 4-24
[normal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#normal-types) undead, 2-12
[heroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#heroic-types) undead, or
1-6 [superheroic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#superheroic-types)
undead.

#### Curses

Curses will affect the invoker and any
[man-types](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) within 15ft.

### Staves & Wands

Staves are employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) as weapons or
for firing spell-like effects as an 8th level caster. A staff holds up
to 200 charges but will have only 10-200 charges when found.

Wands are employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only
and will fire spell-like effects as a 6th level caster. A wand holds up
to 100 charges but will have only 10-100 charges when found.

Each use of a spell-like effect drains one charge unless stated
otherwise.

##### Serpent Staff

Usable by [clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
only, this [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands)
adds +1 to attack and
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls. On a
successful attack the
[cleric](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric) can expend one
charge to transmute the
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) into a
mass of writhing serpents that coil about the target preventing a
[man](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men)-sized opponent from
attacking for 1-4 [turns](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns).
After this period the serpents slither back to their owner and return to
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) form.

##### Staff of Healing

Usable by [clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric)
only, this [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands)
cures 2-7 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) at
a touch. It will function only once on any one person each day.

##### Staff of Mastery

This [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) has
the combined powers of [plant
mastery](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#plant-mastery), [animal
mastery](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#animal-mastery), and
[mastery over
men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mastery-over-men).

##### Staff of Power

Employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only,
this [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) can
invoke a [lightning
bolt](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lightning-bolt),
[fireball](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#fireball), or cone of
intense cold 6" long and up to 2" wide. Each of these cause 8-48 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) but a successful
[saving throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) will
reduce this [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) by
half. Additionally, the
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) may cause
[continuous
light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#continuous-light), [wall of
fire](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wall-of-fire), and
[telekinesis](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#telekinesis) (up to
250 lb). If used in [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat)
it performs as a [staff of
smiting](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staff-of-smiting).

As a last resort the wielder may perform a final strike, thereby
breaking the
[staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) and
releasing all its remaining energy. The resulting blast causes 1 point
of [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) per remaining
charge to all creatures within 3".

##### Staff of Smiting

Uses no charges but causes 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) on a hit.

##### Staff of Sorcery

Employable by
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only,
this [staff](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) has
all the functions of the [staff of
power](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staff-of-power) and can
additionally invoke a whirlwind (as a
[djinn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#a-djinni)),
[invisibility](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#invisibility),
[invoke elemental](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#invoke-elemental)
(8 HD), paralysis (as the
[wand](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands)),
[passwall](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#passwall), [wall of
ice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wall-of-ice), and
[web](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#web).

##### Staff of Wasting

A successful hit causes 1-6 points of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) and ages the target
by one decade. This has little impact upon
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1) but is a terrible
toll upon [men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men).

##### Wand of Cancellation

This [wand](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#staves-and-wands) will

[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

### Magic Swords

Magic swords are usable by
[fighters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) only. In
addition to their attack and
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) adjustments the
greatest magic swords also have
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1),
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment),
[purpose](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#purpose), and the
possibility of spell-like
[powers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#powers). The second magical
adjustment (if given) is applicable to attack and
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls against the
specified target types. The first magical adjustment applies to attack
and [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) rolls against
all other targets.

to one specific
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) including
[men](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#men),
[elves](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elves_1),

to [lycanthropes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#lycanthropes) and
shape-shifters.

##### Versus Enchanted

Causes additional [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
to [magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) and
magic-using [monsters](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2).

##### Versus Giants

Causes additional [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
to [giants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#giants).

##### Versus Dragons

Causes additional harm to one specific type of
[dragon](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons). If this sword is
chaotic it is especially harmful to [golden
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-golden). If this
sword is lawful it is especially harmful to either white, black, green,
blue, or [red dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-red);
otherwise, it will be harmful to any one type.

##### Versus Regenerating

Causes additional [damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage)
to any regenerating creatures including
[trolls](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#trolls),
[clerics](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-cleric), and
characters with regenerating
[rings](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings) or swords.

##### Flametongue

This sword is continually afire with magical flames. It deals +3
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to creatures of
cold and those vulnerable to fire including
[mummies](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#mummies),
[treants](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#treants), and [white
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-white).

##### Frostbrand

This sword glimmers with frigid blue
[light](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#light_2). It deals +3
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) to creatures of
fire and those vulnerable to cold including [fire
elementals](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#elementals-fire),
[efreet](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#an-efreeti), and [red
dragons](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#dragons-red).

##### Holy

This sword is always lawful regardless of its
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1). In
the hands of a lawful
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) it is a sword
+2, +4 versus chaotics and functions as a [ring of spell
turning](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-turning) against
chaotic spell casters; otherwise, it functions only as a sword +2.

##### Unholy

this sword is always chaotic regardless of its
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1). In
the hands of a chaotic
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) it is a sword
+2, +4 versus lawfuls and functions as a [ring of spell
turning](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell-turning) against
lawful spell casters; otherwise, it functions only as a sword +2.

##### Vorpal

This sword is always neutral, regardless of its
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1). In
the hands of a neutral
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) any attack
roll that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in
any case, will decapitate a
[man-type](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#man-types) who fails to
save [versus wands](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wands-and-rays);
otherwise, it functions only as a sword +2.

When a [magic sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords)
is indicated the referee should
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) on the [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) table and then
throw two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) to determine
whether the sword is intelligent. A result of 2-6 indicates a
non-intelligent sword much like other magical weaponry. A result of 7 or
more indicates an intelligent sword with the possibility of additional
[powers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#powers).

#### Intelligence

Some [magic swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords)
are intelligent as determined by a throw of two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1).

Dicing 6 or less indicates a regular magic weapon. Dicing 7 or more
indicates an intelligent, living thing with its own motivations and
personality. The referee should play it as he would any other non-player
character, bearing in mind the sword may not be friendly to its
wielder—this being determined by an initial
[reaction](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#reaction-and-morale-checks)
check and the developing relationship between them.

#### Communication

An intelligent sword is able to communicate. Empathic communication is
via physical hints such as pointing, leaning, shaking, and vibrating.
Verbal communication is via an audible voice spoken in any
[language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages) the sword
knows. An intelligent sword capable of verbal communication will always
know its [alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment)
tongue and a number of additional
[languages](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages)
determined by two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1).

The most intelligent [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) are able to
[read magic](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#read-magic) and to
communicate telepathically in addition to their ability to speak.

#### Alignment

All intelligent [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) are either
lawful, neutral, or chaotic. A
[holy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#holy) sword is always lawful,
an [unholy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#unholy) sword is always
chaotic, and a [vorpal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vorpal)
sword is always neutral, regardless of its
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1).

##### Alignment Damage

Any character who willingly handles an enchanted sword of a different
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) will suffer
1-6 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) for each step its
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) is removed
from his. For example, a lawful player will suffer 2-12 [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice) of
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage) if he handles a
chaotic sword. A character contacting a magical sword unwillingly or
under instruction is spared half this
[damage](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#damage).

#### Ego

All intelligent swords have an ego. The higher a sword’s ego the more
challenging it will be to master. A sword’s ego rating is determined by
throwing two six-sided
[dice](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-dice_1) and adjusting the
result by +1 for each additional
[language](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#many-languages) or
[power](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#powers) the sword possesses
(whichever is greater).

#### Powers

Intelligent swords will possess a number of additional powers and
exceptional powers. The referee should roll on the [Magic
Sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) Powers table
and, if necessary, the [Magic
Sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) Exceptional
Powers table to determine each of these functions.

The wielder is required to hold the sword unsheathed and to concentrate
for a [turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) in order to
invoke any of these powers. Only a single power may be used each
[turn](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#turns) but they can otherwise
be used thrice per day, with the exception of regeneration (which is
continuous) and [wishes](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wishes)
(which can be used a total of 3 or 1-6 times).

Unless noted otherwise, these powers are as the equivalent
[magic-user](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user)
[spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#explanation-of-spells).

A sword with the life stealing power can invoke a finger of death once
per day and is always chaotic. If it is a
[holy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#holy) or
[vorpal](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#vorpal) sword it is
declared an [unholy](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#unholy) sword
instead.

#### Purpose

The most potent [magic
swords](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) have been
forged for a specific purpose.Should a sword have both 9 or more
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1) and 9
or more [ego](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ego) it is a purposed
sword. It will have the maximum
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1) and
[ego](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ego)—promote both to 12 but do
not add [powers](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#powers) if
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1) is
raised.

The purpose of such a sword is determined by dicing on the [Magic
Sword](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#magic-swords) Purpose table.

In all cases the purpose of a sword is according to its
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment). Thus, a
lawful sword purposed to destroy
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) is
purposed to destroy chaotic
[magic-users](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-magic-user) only.
A neutral purposed sword affects lawful and chaotic types equally.

-   A lawful sword will paralyze a purposed foe on a successful hit if
    he fails to save [versus
    petrification](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#paralysis-and-petrification).
-   A neutral sword will
    [feeblemind](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#feeblemind) a
    purposed foe on a successful hit if he fails to save [versus
    spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell). Use confused
    behaviour if already in
    [combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat).
-   A chaotic sword will slay a purposed foe on a successful hit if he
    fails to save [versus
    poison](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#poison).

#### Dominance

An intelligent sword also has a dominance rating which is the sum of its
[intelligence](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#intelligence_1) and
[ego](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#ego).

A sword may mentally wrestle for dominance over its wielder in order to
get its own way when any of the following (or similar) circumstances
arise:

-   Any character willingly draws or even touches the sword,
-   The sword’s [purposed](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#purpose)
    enemy appears,
-   Another magical sword is found,
-   The wielder is reduced to fewer than half of his [hit
    points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).

Compare the sword’s dominance to the sum of the player character’s
[wisdom](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#wisdom),
[charisma](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#charisma), and
[fighter](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-fighter) level. The
player character adds 1-6 if he is fresh and uninjured but subtracts 1-6
if he has fewer than half of his total possible [hit
points](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-numbers-of-hit-dice).
The sword adds 2-12 if its
[alignment](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#alignment) differs from
the player character’s.

If there is any difference in the sword’s favor it gains control over
the character unless he makes a successful [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) [versus
spells](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#spell). If the difference is
6 or more no [saving
throw](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#saving-throws) is allowed.

Whenever a sword dominates its wielder it causes him to act in
accordance with its own goals. This means disposing of competing
weapons, entering into glorious (or ignoble)
[combat](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#combat), decorating itself
with bejeweled hilt-work or scabbards, surrendering itself to a superior
wielder who can better achieve its goals (or an inferior one whom it can
more easily dominate), or any other actions that serve its own end.
Domination is usually exerted for the duration of one such action.

## Afterword

Much has been written down and accounted for, but all the words in this
book are merely a foundation for what will ultimately be a fantasy game
[campaign](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#the-campaign) of the
referee’s own devising. He is encouraged to create liberally and
enthusiastically and to welcome input from his players. Their choices
and actions should [ring](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#rings)
true in the game
[world](http://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#creating-a-world) so that it
thrives and invites further participation. With a living game in motion
the referee can derive considerable enjoyment from extending or altering
the rules to meet his own particular needs. In this case the referee is
cautioned to do so judiciously and with consistency.

Above all, referees and players alike are reminded that this is a game
and that games are meant to be fun.

Fight On!
